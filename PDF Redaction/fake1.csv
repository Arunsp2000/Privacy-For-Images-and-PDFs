"A woman who says she was conned out of £50,000 by her Senegalese husband in a immigration marriage scam wants to help other women avoid the same fate. Kim Sow, 58, from Dover, has been calling for the government to take action since her husband Laye walked out on her after obtaining his British citizenship. She alleges that Laye had been in the UK illegally and she now believes he was already married to at least two other women. Kim Sow appeared on today's This Morning to share her story of how she was 'duped by a love rat' Kim, pictured with Laye, believes he married her to gain her assets and British citizenship . Kim, a music producer was 49 when she first met Laye, then 43, in a London nightclub in 2007. She said there was an 'instant attraction' and their romance had a 'normal progression to a full-on relationship'. He told her he was a widower supporting three young children in Senegal. Kim said she had no reason not to believe him as he even had his wife's death certificate to prove it. 'He said he was a religious man so couldn't live with me if we weren't married. He told me he didn't believe in polygamy and didn't do affairs. 'He told me his wife had died and his children were being cared for by relatives and he had paperwork to prove it,' she told presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden on today's This Morning. Kim, who was unable to have children after an ectopic pregnancy left her infertile, said the prospect of having a ready-made family with Laye was a dream come true. She said: 'When we married, I thought his children would come and live with us. I was so happy. 'One of the attractions for me was that I couldn't have children. I was thrilled to be marrying a man with three lovely children, they were the apple of my eye. I spoke to them on the phone and sent them presents, they were my life. 'I even bought a five bedroom house in Dover where we could live as a family.' Kim and Laye married at Kingston registry office in June 2008. 'I was the happiest woman in the world thinking I had a family and it all came crashing down,' Kim said. The music producer told presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden, left, that she had no reason to believe Laye was still married as he showed her his wife's death certificate . 'I found out he'd had an affair and he said it was because he was missing his children. I gave him a second chance but then found all these other layers of lies and secrets. 'It was all thanks to Facebook that I discovered his real story.' Using the social network site, Kim said she discovered Laye hadn't lied about the death of his first wife, with whom he had one child. But he had gone on to marry another woman in Africa with whom he had his two other children. She found evidence he had then married a Dutch woman and possibly another English woman - and appeared to have ripped them off in similar circumstances to his dealings with her. She also found Facebook messages from Laye to other women he was targeting on dating websites. At the end of her interview, Phillip pointed out charges have not been made against Laye since he left Kim. Following Kim's allegations, police have begun an investigation into Laye for bigamy, fraud and associated crimes. But it is unclear if he is still in Britain. Kim remains adamant he is a 'love rat' who has left her poorer and broken-hearted. Kim is now working with Immigration Marriage Fraud UK to stop others suffering her fate . On This Morning she said she knows people will think she's a fool for being taken in but she said she had done lots of checks away to ensure Laye was who he said he was. 'I don't have imbecile on my forehead,' she said. 'I had checked his paperwork and it had gone through lawyers, embassies and the registry office. I had met him in the UK.' Kim is now working with Immigration Marriage Fraud UK to force government policy change.","A woman who says she was conned out of £50,000 by her Torresstadese husband in a immigration marriage scam wants to help other women avoid the same fate.

"The RAF has spent £37million on bombing raids in its mission to smash ISIS and bring Jihadi John's network to its knees. An investigation by MailOnline has unveiled the grand scale of the military effort against the terrorist group, including more than 100 airstrikes and 195 missiles fired. The bombings, carried out by Britain’s fleet of warplanes and unmanned drones, have targeted more than 180 ISIS positions and have killed dozens of Islamists so far in the six-month campaign. Scroll down for video . The bombings, carried out by Britain’s fleet of warplanes and unmanned drones, have targeted more than 180 ISIS positions (above), with some hit multiple times . The RAF has spent £37million on bombing raids in its mission to smash ISIS, fronted by Jihadi John (pictured), unveiled as Londoner Mohammed Emwazi . The raids, under the code name Operation Shader, have covered swathes of Iraq, with the RAF picking off terrorist targets deep inside ISIS territory. Britain has used Tornado GR4s at least 126 times in attacks on the militants, with each one flown from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus at an estimated cost of £35,000 an hour. With an average flight time of somewhere between four and eight hours - thanks to the help of Voyager air-to-air refuelling tankers accompanying them on each mission - the total cost quickly racks up to around £26.5million. Tornados are usually flown in pairs and are equipped with both Brimstone and Paveway IV missiles. Brimstones - ‘smart bombs’ which can pinpoint small targets in crowded areas - have been fired at least 54 times on trucks, buildings and groups of ISIS terrorists. The missiles cost £105,000 each and account for another £5.67million spent hunting down members of the barbaric group. Britain has used Tornado GR4s at least 126 times in attacks on the militants, with each raid flown from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus in pairs (file picture) Weapons: At least 66 500lb Paveways have been dropped on ISIS in Iraq by the eight RAF Tornados in Iraq . Strike: The targeted bombings have killed dozens of Islamists so far in the six-month campaign . Meanwhile at least 66 500lb Paveways have been dropped on ISIS in Iraq by the eight Tornados the RAF has sent to the region. The heavier weapons are used on larger targets and cost £22,000 each. Because of the threat posed by Tornados to the Islamists, they have taken to travelling at night or in poor weather to avoid being seen. But this does not stop Britain’s fleet of 10 unmanned Reaper drones, which can locate and fire on small targets from as high as 45,000ft, from picking off ISIS convoys trying to take advantage of poor visibility. Reapers, which can fly for up to 30 hours before needing to refuel, have fired on the extremists 75 times during the RAF mission, which started in October last year. During 101 airstrikes on ISIS in Iraq, the RAF has fired: . 75 Hellfire missiles . 66 Paveway IV laser-guided bombs . 54 Brimstone missiles . The drones use aptly-named Hellfire missiles, which can incinerate targets in a burst of flames before they are even aware they are being fired upon and cost £46,000 a unit. The full £37million fight against ISIS does not include the costs of flying the drones, which are each worth around £8.5million, as their operation is shrouded in secrecy. The Ministry of Defence does not reveal where the drones take off and land, or even where they are ‘piloted’ from - however previous reports suggest they take off from Kuwait and are piloted remotely 4,600 miles away in Lincolnshire. In all, the 101 missions MailOnline are aware of have destroyed 186 ISIS targets, which includes command points, checkpoints and military convoys. According to a YouGov poll, more than 60 per cent of the British public approve of the bombings in Iraq. This is a 10 per cent rise from in September, showing the continued released of brutal snuff videos by the terrorists, such as the sickening beheadings by Jihadi John, unveiled last month as Londoner Mohammed Emwazi, have only caused the public to further back the UK mission. Critics have called for the RAF mission to be stepped up, despite David Cameron insisting that Britain’s role in Iraq is second only to that of the U.S.. Aerial attack: Reapers, which can fly for up to 30 hours before needing to refuel, have fired on the extremists 75 times during the RAF mission . The Commons Defence Committee said the RAF’s role in Iraq was ‘surprisingly modest’ and that the air force was only carrying out one strike a day. Dr Afzal Ashraf, from the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies, said the RAF could only play a limited part in the fight against ISIS without the help of boots on the ground. He said: ‘The RAF plays has a small part of the total campaign against ISIS. 'They've done a good job but the problem with airpower is the target they face. Targets have to be fixed unless aircraft react fast to moving targets. This is particularly an issue with the predominant use of fast jets rather than close air support aircraft.’ ‘ISIS have learnt to adapt to the attacks. They very rarely move in broad daylight - they do so in bad weather and in small numbers. This makes it hard for the RAF to find valuable targets. 'The RAF has done as much as it can because of airpower's limited and perishable impact. Unless you have ground troops to exploit the impact airpower has, it can't be sustained.’ Britain has also provided 40 heavy machine guns to the Kurds, who are fighting against ISIS in Iraq, but this pales in significance when compared to Germany, which has sent more than 35,000 weapons to the fighters. UK forces have provided training to Peshmerga fighters, as well as sending around 400 support personnel to northern Iraq. While the MoD does not comment on ongoing operations, its latest update on the strikes on ISIS says: ‘Military support is just one part of the UK government’s contribution to the global coalition strategy to defeat ISIL – we are also taking action to counter the terrorist network’s finances, are restricting the flow of foreign fighters and have provided vital humanitarian relief to help those affected by ISIL’s brutality. ‘British military training teams continue to teach infantry and first aid skills to the Kurdish peshmerga, and liaison teams are embedded within Iraqi and coalition headquarters. ‘Having previously provided military equipment to the Iraqi forces, Britain plans to gift improvised explosive device (IED) detectors to help the Iraqi and Kurdish soldiers protect themselves against the numerous improvised explosive devices on which ISIL are increasingly relying as they are forced back by successful offensives. ‘In the Gulf, the Royal Navy’s Type 45 destroyer HMS Dauntless is operating in direct support of the US Navy’s aircraft carrier, USS Carl Vinson, which provides a significant part of the coalition’s air effort.’","The RAF has spent £37million on bombing raids in its mission to smash ISIS and bring Brandy Sanders network to its knees. An investigation by MailOnline has unveiled the grand scale of the military effort against the terrorist group, including more than 100 airstrikes and 195 missiles fired. The bombings, carried out by Jasonfurt’s fleet of warplanes and unmanned drones, have targeted more than 180 ISIS positions and have killed dozens of Islamists so far in the six-month campaign. Scroll down for video . The bombings, carried out by Jasonfurt’s fleet of warplanes and unmanned drones, have targeted more than 180 ISIS positions (above), with some hit multiple times . The RAF has spent £37million on bombing raids in its mission to smash ISIS, fronted by Brandy Sanders Katrina Harris (pictured), unveiled as Natalie Singleton . The raids, under the code name Operation Shader, have covered swathes of Lake Walter, with the RAF picking off terrorist targets deep inside ISIS territory. Jasonfurt has used Tornado GR4s at least 126 times in attacks on the militants, with each one flown from RAF Akrotiri in East Feliciamouth at an estimated cost of £35,000 an hour. With an average flight time of somewhere between four and eight hours - thanks to the help of Voyager air-to-air refuelling tankers accompanying them on each mission - the total cost quickly racks up to around £26.5million. North Katherine are usually flown in pairs and are equipped with both Brimstone and Paveway IV missiles. Brimstones - ‘smart bombs’ which can pinpoint small targets in crowded areas - have been fired at least 54 times on trucks, buildings and groups of ISIS terrorists. The missiles cost £105,000 each and account for another £5.67million spent hunting down members of the barbaric group. Jasonfurt has used Tornado GR4s at least 126 times in attacks on the militants, with each raid flown from RAF Akrotiri in East Feliciamouth in pairs (file picture) Weapons: At least 66 500lb Paveways have been dropped on ISIS in Lake Walter by the eight RAF North Katherine in Lake Walter . Strike: The targeted bombings have killed dozens of Islamists so far in the six-month campaign . Meanwhile at least 66 500lb Paveways have been dropped on ISIS in Lake Walter by the eight North Katherine the RAF has sent to the region. The heavier weapons are used on larger targets and cost £22,000 each. Because of the threat posed by North Katherine to the Islamists, they have taken to travelling at night or in poor weather to avoid being seen. But this does not stop Jasonfurt’s fleet of 10 unmanned Reaper drones, which can locate and fire on small targets from as high as 45,000ft, from picking off ISIS convoys trying to take advantage of poor visibility. Reapers, which can fly for up to 30 hours before needing to refuel, have fired on the extremists 75 times during the RAF mission, which started in October last year. During 101 airstrikes on ISIS in Lake Walter, the RAF has fired: . 75 Hellfire missiles . 66 Paveway IV laser-guided bombs . 54 Brimstone missiles . The drones use aptly-named Hellfire missiles, which can incinerate targets in a burst of flames before they are even aware they are being fired upon and cost £46,000 a unit. The full £37million fight against ISIS does not include the costs of flying the drones, which are each worth around £8.5million, as their operation is shrouded in secrecy. The Ministry of Defence does not reveal where the drones take off and land, or even where they are ‘piloted’ from - however previous reports suggest they take off from Lake Patriciatown and are piloted remotely 4,600 miles away in East Kiara. In all, the 101 missions MailOnline are aware of have destroyed 186 ISIS targets, which includes command points, checkpoints and military convoys. According to a YouGov poll, more than 60 per cent of the British public approve of the bombings in Lake Walter. This is a 10 per cent rise from in September, showing the continued released of brutal snuff videos by the terrorists, such as the sickening beheadings by Brandy Sanders Katrina Harris, unveiled last month as Natalie Singleton, have only caused the public to further back the Sheilaberg mission. Critics have called for the RAF mission to be stepped up, despite Sherry Williams insisting that Jasonfurt’s role in Lake Walter is second only to that of the Cohenmouth..

"A judge on Tuesday ordered jurors in the Jodi Arias case to keep deliberating after her lawyers said the panel had reached an impasse on whether to sentence her to death or life in prison for killing her lover in 2008. Arias, now 34, was convicted of first-degree murder in 2013 after a lengthy trial that became a sensation with its tawdry revelations about her relationship with victim Travis Alexander. That jury deadlocked on her punishment. Authorities said Alexander, 30, was found dead in the shower of his Mesa home after Arias shot him in the forehead and slit his throat so deeply that he was nearly decapitated. On Tuesday, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Sherry Stephens denied a request by Arias' attorneys for a mistrial and instead read additional jury instructions to the jury in her sentencing retrial. The jury had deliberated about 17 hours over four days. Scroll down for video . Deadlocked: A lawyer for Jodi Arias says jurors at her sentencing retrial are at an impasse over whether to sentence the convicted murderer to life in prison or death for the 2008 killing of her lover. Arias is seen here in court on February 24 . Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi pleaded for Arias' (pictured with defense attorney Jennifer Willmott) life during his closing arguments last Tuesday, saying she was physically and emotionally abused by Alexander . Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi said in court that jurors were at an impasse, though the judge and prosecutor Juan Martinez never confirmed that in open court. Jurors posed two questions to Stephens, who didn't reveal details. The judge and lawyers held closed-door discussions shortly before jurors were brought into the courtroom. Stephens told them that she didn't intend to force a verdict and said in her instructions that jurors shouldn't weigh evidence based on the views of other jurors. If the current jury can't decide on a sentence, the death penalty would be removed as an option and the judge would decide if Arias serves life in prison or gets a chance for release after 25 years. Last week, Nurmi pleaded Arias' life, saying she was physically and emotionally abused as a child and by former boyfriend Alexander. Nurmi said Alexander was a conflicted Mormon, who used Arias to satisfy his sexual desires and called her 'soulless'. 'Those words have impact and they got to her,' Nurmi said. Arias cried as prosecutor Juan Martinez displayed gruesome autopsy photographs of Alexander on a large screen during his closing argument. Arias cried as prosecutor Juan Martinez (pictured during closing arguments on Feb 24) displayed gruesome autopsy photographs of Alexander on a large screen during his closing argument and called Arias a liar . If the jury reaches deadlock, the death penalty will automatically be thrown out as an option and Judge Sherry Stephens (pictured on Feb 24) will sentence Arias either to life in prison or life with the possibility of parole after 25 years . Martinez described Arias as a liar who was trying to trick the jury into believing she was the victim. He then pointed to the photograph of Alexander's decomposed body, covered in stab wounds, his throat cut and a gunshot wound to the forehead. 'That's what she wants you to believe,' he said. 'But actually, in reality, it's this.' Alexander's family and friends sobbed in the courtroom as the gruesome photographs were displayed. So concluded the five-month sentencing phase that was much quieter than the 2013 murder trial that made Arias a cable television and tabloid sensation. Arias stabbed Alexander nearly 30 times, nearly decapitated him when she slit his throat and shot him in the forehead in an act she claimed was in self-defense. Alexander's body was found in the shower of his Phoenix home by his friends five days later. Prosecutors said Arias had planned the murder in advance because she was jealous Alexander wanted to break up with her and was planning a trip to Mexico with another woman. Arias claimed Alexander was abusive and obsessed with sex. After she was convicted of murder, Arias said during a jailhouse interview with Fox that she desired the death penalty because it was the 'ultimate freedom'.

Arias stabbed Alexander 30 times, nearly decapitated him when she slit his throat and shot him in the forehead . Alexander's body was found in the shower of his Phoenix home by his friends five days later . But the trial's jury deadlocked when debating Arias ultimate fate, requiring a second sentencing phase. Arias' new trial began in October and Judge Sherry Stephens banned news organizations from live broadcasting the case. She ruled that court proceedings could only be aired after the verdict, which  can be aired live. In November, Arias pleaded for her life in front of the jury. The judge allowed her to testify in secret and sealed the testimony to the public, but transcripts were released after news organizations complained and an appeals court threw out the decision. If Arias receives the death penalty she will be only the third woman on death row in Arizona. The new jury of eight woman and four men left for the day on Wednesday without having reached a decision. If they reach deadlock the death penalty will automatically be thrown out as an option and Judge Stephens will sentence Arias either to life in prison or life with the possibility of parole after 25 years.","A judge on Tuesday ordered jurors in the Jean Walter case to keep deliberating after her lawyers said the panel had reached an impasse on whether to sentence her to death or life in prison for killing her lover in 2008.

"It may not have the slick design of Apple's Watch - or the extortionate price tag - but Microsoft is hoping its Band fitness tracker and watch will rival the likes of Fitbit as well as the Moto 360.

It was released in the US last year in select stores but is now available to pre-order in the UK. It goes on general sale on 15 April . The wrist-worn device has 10 smart sensors inside the band and a colourful touchscreen. In addition to tracking activity, it also offers guided workouts tailored to  a user's exercise goals and GPS route mapping so users can see where they have run or cycled. 'Microsoft Band makes it easier to reach your fitness goals. You can track your daily physical activity and review your stats with a glance at your wrist,' said the Washington-based company. 'Just like a personal trainer, Microsoft Band guides you to improved wellness by constantly learning about you, your current fitness level, and your future needs.' It doesn't let users make phone calls from the device, but like other smartwatches such as the Moto 360, they can read texts, emails, social media updates and see other notifications.

And all of these features, stats and notifications can be customised on the Microsoft Health app that isn't tied to Microsoft's Windows Phone and works across Android and iOS as well. However, the Cortana personal assistant feature is only available for people using a Windows 8.1 device. Through Microsoft Health, all of the data is stored in the cloud and can be given to doctors, physiotherapists or used for other clinical reasons. Fitness functions: The band is primarily a fitness band. It features smart sensors that monitor pulse rate, measure calorie burn and track sleep quality. The device also offers workouts put together by Men's Health of Gold's Gym, for example, and GPS route mapping so users can see where they have ran or cycled. Smartwatch features: The device doesn't allow people to make calls directly, but does push notifications about calls, texts and emails from a user's smartphone to their Microsoft Band. It has Microsoft's Cortana personal assistant built-in so people can talk to the device to ask it to take notes or set reminders, for example. Appearance: The band is made of rubber and features a colour touchscreen. Users can change the background screen's colour and design on the Microsoft Health app. App: The Band syncs with Microsoft Health and works with iPhone, Android and Windows Phone handsets. It additionally syncs with other health and fitness devices and services such as UP by Jawbone, MapMyFitness and RunKeeper. Sensors: It has 10 sensors that monitor everything from heart rate and sleep to UV, prompting wearers to apply sunscreen. Price: $199 in the US and £169.99 in the UK. Availability: It is available to pre-order today and goes on general sale on 15 April. For example, the sleep tracking function can highlight if someone is suffering from sleep apnoea - a condition that causes interrupted breathing during sleep - by tracking heart rate. Microsoft Health additionally syncs with other health and fitness devices and services such as UP by Jawbone, MapMyFitness and RunKeeper. Data from these different devices and services, such as steps, calories and heart rate can then be combined, enabling an 'Intelligence Engine' which reveals which exercises were most effective during a workout and suggest a recommended recovery time. This also shows detailed information about when a person entered the aerobic and anaerobic states during a workout to help people more accurately track their fitness or boost weight loss. Over time, this data can be combined with a calendar to make the Intelligence Machine smarter and offer suggestions for workouts that fit with a user's schedule.

This app additionally syncs with other health and fitness devices and services such as UP by Jawbone, MapMyFitness and RunKeeper . There is a plethora of fitness trackers on the market, and an increasing number of smartwatches, but despite this competition Microsoft's Band still manages to stand out. It's not the best looking device, and by trying to cram in as many sensors as possible Microsoft appears to have forgotten that it needs to be worn for long periods of time. Its stiff rubber band is uncomfortable and bulky and its clasp is not easy to do up one-handed. Its green light, which reveals when the heart rate is being tracked, is also too bright - especially during the night, and when wearing it to sleep it ended up bruising my arm. However, its features more than make up for this shortcoming. The Band has many of the tools seen on other trackers and smartwatches but does them much better. Not only does it track heart rate constantly, which helps give a more accurate representation of calories burnt, respiration and sleep than other devices, it also gives more detailed insights into all of your activity. The Band (pictured) is available for pre-order from Amazon, Currys PC World and Microsoft Store or via O2 . For example, during sleep it reveals heart rate on a graph, tells you how long you slept and how much of this was classed as so-called restful sleep. It tracks your sleep efficiency and tells you how many calories were burnt as you were dozing. And during exercise this heart rate tracker plots when you entered aerobic or an anaerobic state, tells you how many calories were burnt during each stage and reveals how long you should recover before exercising again. The Guided Workout section lets you pick and choose for a list of exercise routines and the band gently vibrates to tell you to move onto the next activity. This is preferable to watching a video or having audio beeps. These vibrations are also used to alert a user to Facebook and Twitter notifications, emails and text messages and a Quick Read button will show the text of these notifications word-by-word so you don't have to scroll through on the small screen. The Band was the first wearable that stopped me reaching for my phone every 10 minutes or so. The only criticism of these sensors is that the pedometer, in particular, is a little sensitive and occasionally tracked single steps when driving in a car and hitting a pot hole or going over a speed bump. Microsoft claims the battery last for two days and during our tests it exceeded this. We ran a 5K on day one and walked an hour and 10 minutes on the second day, as well as received countless notifications and alerts and the phone lasted a staggering 53 hours on a single charge. This is even more impressive when you consider it is tracking heart rate constantly, and is used overnight during sleep. But the most impressive feature is the price. All of these features cost just £169.99 in the UK and $199 in the US. This is almost half the price of Apple's Watch and $50 cheaper than the Moto 360 in the US and £30 cheaper than the Fitbit Surge in the UK. It's not perfect, and the price reflects the poor design, but for a first foray into this industry its a decent effort.

And during exercise this heart rate tracker plots when you entered aerobic or an anaerobic state, tells you how many calories were burnt during each stage and reveals how long you should recover before exercising again. The Guided Workout section lets you pick and choose for a list of exercise routines and the band gently vibrates to tell you to move onto the next activity. This is preferable to watching a video or having audio beeps. These vibrations are also used to alert a user to Facebook and Twitter notifications, emails and text messages and a Quick Read button will show the text of these notifications word-by-word so you don't have to scroll through on the small screen. The Band was the first wearable that stopped me reaching for my phone every 10 minutes or so. The only criticism of these sensors is that the pedometer, in particular, is a little sensitive and occasionally tracked single steps when driving in a car and hitting a pot hole or going over a speed bump. Microsoft claims the battery last for two days and during our tests it exceeded this. We ran a 5K on day one and walked an hour and 10 minutes on the second day, as well as received countless notifications and alerts and the phone lasted a staggering 53 hours on a single charge. This is even more impressive when you consider it is tracking heart rate constantly, and is used overnight during sleep. But the most impressive feature is the price. All of these features cost just £169.99 in the Fitzgeraldborough and $199 in the Lambmouth. This is almost half the price of Apple's Watch and $50 cheaper than the Moto 360 in the Lambmouth and £30 cheaper than the Fitbit Surge in the Fitzgeraldborough. It's not perfect, and the price reflects the poor design, but for a first foray into this industry its a decent effort. Robert Miller ."
"Not all home owners have enjoyed the famed big returns of Sydney's property boom, analysts reveal. While median home prices have leapt by at least 30 per cent across Sydney, home prices in some of the city's more 'prestigious', mostly waterfront postcodes have hardly budged in the last two years. Analysts say this is because higher-end buyers and sellers are more influenced by fluctuations in the stock market than by low interest rates which sparked the boom in budget and middle sectors of the market.

"A terrifying anonymous letter telling the founder of a not-for-profit to 'watch your back' also included threats against the woman's daughter, claiming they knew where she went to school. Lordina Jane, President and Founder of Palm Oil Investigations (POI) discovered the harrowing letter on Tuesday, ahead of the release of the POI app on Wednesday evening. The free app - developed by the not-for-profit over the past 12 months - will inform consumers about the palm oil content of the products available on supermarket shelves. 'When I opened that letter I went cold... I took the letter and went straight to the police,' Lorinda told Daily Mail Australia. This anonymous letter was sent to Palm Oil Investigations (POI) President Lorina Jane threatening her, and her daughter and claiming to know where they live . 'It's a really gutless thing to do... The person who sent it has been that gutless they wouldn't put their name to it.' Lorinda is the founder and president of the not-for-profit  which provides information to consumers about products that contain palm oil . Coming from an anonymous source, the letter made claims that should their company feature 'unfavourably' in the new app, 'we will be your worst enemy'. 'We know you are soon to release a phone app about products with palm oil in,' the letter began. 'If our company is listed unfavourably we will be your worst enemy. 'If our listing has a negative effect on our company, we know where you live, we know you have a daughter and we know where she goes to school. You will both need to watch your back,' it continued. 'You have bragged online that your app will be a ‘game changer’, it well may be only not how you expect,' the letter concluded, . Lorinda said in the years since the POI launched their Facebook page - which has over 144,000 'likes' - they have never encouraged any consumers to boycott particular brands, but are about simply providing information. The letter, which was printed and not handwritten, and featured no company markings, is the first of its kind according to the POI founder. Lorinda believes it could have come from a smaller brand they have contacted in the process of putting together their app - which acts as a barcode scanner and puts products into five categories. The threats came a day ahead of the release of the POI app, which aims to inform consumers about the palm oil content of the products they consume . The first category is palm oil free, the second indicates the company has signed on to stop deforestation, the third is palm oil certified - which means they use ethically sourced oil, the fourth is for companies or products which used a mixed supply of certified and uncertified oil, and the final is a fail. A fail means the company have refused to provide details when approached by POI, or that they use uncertified palm oil. 'It is going to make big waves,' Lorinda said, speaking of the app. 'I don’t know what this person or company thinks they’re going to achieve. It's not the correct way to approach us'. 'Whoever it is is worried… in a way that’s a good thing because it shows the app is going to do exactly what it’s meant to,' she continued. In recent years there has been controversy over illegal deforestation in south-east Asia . Animals such as orangutans, tigers and elephants are losing their natural habitats to the deforestation . As a single mother to her young daughter, the POI founder said the letter was frightening, and it was now being investigated by detectives. And she had a message for the anonymous sender: 'If they’re worried, why not send us a letter and say how are our brands sitting in that app … instead of sending something like that'. A controversial ingredient in recent years, palm oil is used in a large amount of products found on supermarket shelves, from foods to beauty and cleaning products. The issue surrounding the resource stems from the illegal deforestation of areas in Borneo and Sumatra, which is having a devastating impact on the animals that call these areas home. Orangutans, tigers, rhinoceroses and elephants are among the native animals which face extinction as more and more land is cleared to harvest the cheap oil. Harvesting the crops from which the oil comes from is not the issue at the centre of the debate, rather the uncertified and dangerous ways the resource is being collected and sold.","A terrifying anonymous letter telling the founder of a not-for-profit to 'watch your back' also included threats against the woman's daughter, claiming they knew where she went to school.

"Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney will hope his side are at top gear at Anfield on Sunday, as he headed into training in his new BMW i8 hybrid sports car. The 29-year-old showed off his new wheels at Carrington as Manchester United prepare to take on Liverpool in a crucial clash in pursuit of Champions League qualification. Liverpool are only two points behind Louis van Gaal’s side, who are occupying the fourth qualifying position, but Brendan Rodgers’ side haven’t lost in the Premier League since losing 3-0 at Old Trafford in December. Wayne Rooney heads into Manchester United training in his sparkling new £104,590 BMW i8 sports car . Rooney relaxes at the wheel of his new motor as he prepares to take on Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday . Rooney has splashed out £104,590 on his new BMW i8 having scored five goals in his last six Manchester United appearances. The new hybrid from BMW uses the combination of an electric motor and a powerful petrol engine which provide extremely low emissions into the environment. Rooney will certainly be quick into training as the sports car can accelerate from 0-62mph in just 4.4 seconds, and has a top speed limited to 155mph.

"The man accused of horrifically murdering 10 puppies earlier this week has pleaded guilty to four counts of animal cruelty. Nathan Thompson allegedly loaded 11 bull terriers cross puppies into his car and took them to bushland at McLeods Road, Kurri Kurri on Wednesday, according to the Daily Telegraph. As a result of his plea, Thompson cannot own, acquire, buy or possess any animal, or even be around another animal without an adult present, for a decade. Scroll down for video . Nathan Thompson, 25, allegedly loaded 11 Bull Terriers in his car and took them to bushland at McLeods Road, Kurri Kurri - north of Sydney - on Wednesday afternoon. Only one of the animals survived (pictured) Thompson (pictured) leaves East Maitland Court after pleading guilty to animal abuse . Magistrate Caleb Franklin granted Thompson bail to be sentenced on April 28. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Thompson made comments at his home after being released on bail saying he knew he looked 'cold blooded' but he believed he was helping out a friend. 'People are looking at me like I'm a cold-blooded killer because of what I have done and I can understand that,' he said. But he 'loved his dog' and was shattered that she was confiscated. The  25-year-old allegedly loaded 11 Bull Terriers in his car and took them to bushland at McLeods Road, Kurri Kurri - north of Sydney - on Wednesday afternoon. Police say an advertisement on Gumtree was placed online last Thursday for the sale of 11 Bull Terrier cross puppies. Almost a week later, it is alleged the owner had not sold the dogs and offered the puppies free of charge to the 25-year-old who accepted. It's alleged that a witness saw the 25-year-old man begin to kill a number of the puppies, aged six to eight weeks, by hitting them over the head with a rock, then throwing them into the bush. The witness confronted the man, who drove from the area with five of the dogs still alive. The RSPCA were contacted and attended the location, before taking the attacked puppies to a vet. Only one of the animals, named Lucky, survived. David O'Shannessy, RSPCA NSW's chief inspector, told Daily Mail Australia he was shocked by the incident. 'We deal with a lot of cases but in this particular incident someone has allegedly gone out of their way to do something to the dogs which makes it even more concerning for us,' he said. 'This sort of situation doesn't have to occur.' Mr O'Shannessy says by the time the RSPCA arrived at the scene only two dogs were alive. Nathan Thompson, the man accused of horrifically murdering 10 puppies,  pleaded guilty to four counts of animal cruelty . 'There were seven pups in total when we arrived and five of them were deceased,' he said. 'Most of them had significant head injuries so you can image what the scene was like when we got there. 'The inspectors quickly transported the surviving dogs to the clinic but one of them died on the way.' Police and RSPCA arrested the 25-year-old at a house in Kurri Kurri on Thursday. Police say the man allegedly told them four of the five remaining puppies were destroyed and the fifth was re-homed. 'Something's not quite right with the numbers so we've made some inquiries about the other dogs,' Mr O'Shannessy said. Lucky, the surviving dog, is in the care of the RSCPA and is stable, however Mr O'Shannessy says he has 'grave concerns' for her. 'She appeared to have some injuries and had blood shot eyes when we rescued her,' he said. 'But who knows what Lucky's witnessed.'

Daniel Duarte, the surviving dog, is in the care of the RSCPA and is stable, however Mr Jacob Stewart says he has 'grave concerns' for her. 'She appeared to have some injuries and had blood shot eyes when we rescued her,' he said. 'But who knows what Daniel Duarte's witnessed.'

"Nick Clegg today challenged the Tories come clean about where the axe will fall, just 24 hours after the coalition ended. The Lib Dem leader accused David Cameron and George Osborne of 'trying to pull the wool over your eyes' by promising to protect the NHS without spelling out how he will pay for it. He said that only the Lib Dems have promised to find the £8billion which NHS chiefs say will be needed by 2020, and how the money will be found. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, who tried his hand at making pancakes at a Panasonic Manufacturing site in Cardiff, took aim at Chancellor George Osborne, who spent the day making making dough at a Pizza Express in Hove . Simon Stevens, the head of NHS England, has warned that by the end of the decade the health service will need an extra £8billion-a-year. Mr Clegg boasted that he would ensure the NHS got the money, but he said Labour had not made that pledge and the Tories 'try to give the impression they have, but they haven't'. At an election campaign press conference at the National Liberal Club in central London he said: 'We know the Conservatives won't ask the wealthiest to pay a penny more so every spending commitment they make has to be met by deeper and deeper cuts elsewhere. 'So, George Osborne, Jeremy Hunt - where will the axe fall? Soldiers, schools social workers? The only people the Tories have said they will protect are their friends in big business and in big houses. 'The Conservatives are trying to pull the wool over your eyes by not telling you how they will give the NHS the resources it needs.' Mr Osborne was visiting Hove on the south coast as a row raged over spending cuts planned after the election . The Tories have promised to give the NHS the money it needs, but the Lib Dems say they have not been clear about where the money will come from . Mr Clegg added: 'The dividing lines of this election are becoming clearer by the day. The Conservatives will cut too much, Labour will borrow too much. Excessive cuts or excessive borrowing. It's a dismal choice. 'What you want is a balanced budget and stronger public services. That's what the Liberal Democrats offer.' The Lib Dems were the first to publicly commit to providing 'in full' the extra £8 billion a year the NHS boss says it needs by 2020. The party promises to repeat the £2 billion annual 'down payment' announced by Mr Osborne each year to 2020 and add £1 billion from a tax squeeze on high earners and ending the Conservative 'shares for rights' policy. But the bulk of the extra is slated to come from increasing public spending in line with economic growth after eliminating the structural deficit in 2017-18. Mr Clegg used a press conference at the National Liberal Club to claim only the Lib Dems have spelt out how to fund £8billion extra for the NHS . Mr Clegg said the Liberal Democrats would be 'pretty specific' about exactly where the party's preferred tax rises would hit by the time voters go to the polls . The Lib Dems today pledged an extra £2.5billion for mental health care to end 'decades of institutionalised discrimination' in the NHS. Nick Clegg said his party had proved they were serious about the issue by campaigning 'remorselessly' in government for improved services, with some success. Some £250 million over five years will be spent on services for pregnant women and mothers dealing with depression. This would include eight new mother and baby units providing inpatient care and 40 new community services helping new mothers adjust to life at home with a newborn. New waiting time standards will be introduced for people in crisis and for conditions like bipolar disorder so that those who are ill know how long they have to wait. The funding would also mean hundreds of thousands more people will get access to talking therapies for anxiety and depression. A commitment to boost funding for health, with a particular focus on mental health, will be on the front page of the Lib Dem election manifesto, indicating it will be a key priority in any coalition talks after the General Election. Felicity Dormon, senior policy fellow at the Health Foundation charity, said well-targeted extra funding for mental health could improve the quality of NHS care but questioned what other areas of health would lose cash as a result. However, this raises questions about what happens if the economy does not grow as rapidly as hoped. Mr Clegg said it was 'perfectly legitimate' to base policy on current projections. 'You can only operate on a set of assumptions. That's what any economist does. Since I can't tell you precisely in the future what is going to happen, I can tell you that we base our plans on the predictions that are given independently by the Office of Budget Responsibility,' he said. Asked what the plan would be if growth was slower, he said: 'Well, what do I do if the world comes to an end next Tuesday? 'The greatest threat to ongoing growth in the British economy is that we don't continue the balanced approach to fiscal consolidation and maintain the stability which has led to far greater growth than many predicted.' Mr Clegg went on: 'Ed Miliband, David Cameron, it's time to come clean: will you or will you not give the NHS the £8 billion a year by 2020 that it needs and tell us how you plan to fund it? 'The Liberal Democrats have. If you care about the NHS as much as you claim to, you should too.' Mr Clegg said the Liberal Democrats would be 'pretty specific' about exactly where the party's preferred tax rises would fall by the time voters go to the polls. It says £6 billion of the cost of balancing the books should come from increased tax - with the same sum found from a clampdown on tax dodgers, £12 billion in Whitehall cuts and around £3.5 from a squeeze on welfare. 'I accept the challenge that we should show how that £6 billion is arrived at in additional taxes but I think we have already provided far more detail than any other party in the early stages of this election campaign,' Mr Clegg said. 'On taxes we will be pretty specific.'","Stephanie Cox today challenged the Tories come clean about where the axe will fall, just 24 hours after the coalition ended.

"(CNN)She was the first person to contract Ebola in the United States, and now she's suing the hospital where she got infected. Nina Pham, a nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, filed a lawsuit Monday against the hospital's parent company, Texas Health Resources. She claims the company made her ""a symbol of corporate neglect -- a casualty of a hospital system's failure to prepare for a known and impending medical crisis."" THR ignored Ebola warnings, its chief medical officer ""made numerous patently false statements to Congress,"" and the company ""wholly failed to ensure that appropriate polices, procedures, and equipment were in place,"" leaving health care providers untrained, unprotected and at risk for exposure, the lawsuit says. ""I was hoping that THR would be more open and honest about everything that happened at the hospital, and the things they didn't do that led to me getting infected with Ebola,"" Pham said in a statement. ""But that didn't happen and I felt I was left with no choice but to turn to the courts for help."" The company's CEO, Barclay Berdan, sent a letter to employees Monday night after news of the lawsuit broke. ""Nina and so many others of you served very bravely during a most difficult time as we all struggled to deal with the first case of Ebola to arrive in a U.S. hospital's emergency room,"" the statement read. ""Texas Health Resources values our strong culture of caring and compassion, and we view all employees as part of our family.  That's why we have continued to support Nina both during and after her illness, and it's why she is still a member of our team."" According to the suit, the hospital chain failed to provide proper training to handle Ebola. Pham contracted the disease last fall while treating Thomas Eric Duncan, who started showing symptoms after arriving in Dallas from Liberia. ""In a cruel twist, after watching Mr. Duncan go through the horrific and painful course of the disease as she desperately tried to save his life, Nina herself was diagnosed with Ebola just two days after Mr. Duncan's life was taken by it,"" the lawsuit states. Because the hospital initially discharged Duncan when he arrived seeking treatment, it hurt his chances of beating the virus, the lawsuit says. ""Had THR heeded the CDC and other warnings and ensured its hospitals were ready for Ebola, Mr. Duncan would have had the best opportunity to possibly survive,"" it says. Pham also claims that the hospital failed to provide her with the necessary protective equipment, despite CDC warnings. ""Based on what she could learn from the Internet, on the first day she cared for Mr. Duncan, Nina put on a regular isolation gown covering her front and back, double gloves, a surgical mask with plastic shield and double booties. Importantly, Nina's neck and hair remained exposed. Nina was not even (provided) disposable scrubs or a change of clothes. She had to wear the scrubs she wore that first day home, taking out of the hospital clothing that was potentially carrying the virus,"" the lawsuit says. When her mother learned she was treating Duncan, she tried to persuade her to call in sick or even quit, but Pham replied, ""Mom, I can't abandon him. He is my patient. It's my job. I'm going back,"" according to the lawsuit. Texas Health Resources spokesman Wendell Watson issued a statement in response to the lawsuit: . ""Nina Pham served very bravely during a most difficult time as we all struggled to deal with the first case of Ebola to arrive in a U.S. hospital's emergency room. Texas Health Resources has a strong culture of caring and compassion, and we view all our employees as part of our family. That's why we have continued to support Nina both during and after her illness, and it's why she is still a member of our team.  As distressing as the lawsuit is to us, we remain optimistic that we can resolve this matter with Nina."" Comparing the conditions facing nurses to what one would expect in a poorly developed country, the suit further states that after Duncan died, Pham was told she was at ""no risk"" for Ebola ""and that she could freely see her friends and family."" Two days later, she found out she had Ebola. ""THR quickly learned that Nina and her dog Bentley had enormous public support and sympathy. So THR began trying to use Nina as a PR tool to save its plummeting image. While Nina laid in isolation, heavily medicated and facing a potentially gruesome death, THR had its PR department calling Nina. The PR Department was trying to release information and use Nina as part of its THR-corporate-driven #PresbyProud campaign,"" the lawsuit says. Pham's lawsuit also says Texas Health Resources violated her privacy by sharing her medical records. In his letter to employees, Berdan said the company had Pham's permission to release information. ""THR was sensitive to Nina's privacy, and we adhered to HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) rules in determining what information to share publicly,"" the CEO said. ""We had Nina's consent to share the information about her that was released."" Another nurse treating Duncan, Amber Vinson, also contracted Ebola. Both nurses recovered after being sent to hospitals specially equipped and staffed to handle Ebola -- Pham at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland, and Vinson at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. Pham is still employed and is getting a paycheck from Texas Health Resources, but has not returned to work, CNN affiliate KTVT said. She is still suffering fatigue and body aches, but her lawyer told the affiliate it's not clear whether the ailments are from Ebola or from the experimental drugs Pham received. She also experiences anxiety and frequent nightmares and suffers from the stigma of being the Ebola nurse and she may not nurse again, the lawsuit says . ""Professionally, she doubts whether she can ever be a critical care nurse again -- in part because of the emotional stress and anxiety over the trauma she experienced and in part because of the fear and stigma that follows her. So despite only just beginning to pursue her dream of a career in critical care nursing, Nina is now faced with the possibility of never returning to her passion,"" the lawsuit says. The lawsuit seeks damages for past and future physical pain, mental anguish, physical impairment, loss of enjoyment of life, medical expenses, loss of earning capacity and loss of reputation the lawsuit says. It does not set an amount for damages sought. ""The fact is, I'm facing a number of issues with regard to my health and my career and the lawsuit provides a way to address them,"" Pham said in her statement. ""But more importantly, it will help uncover the truth of what happened, and educate all health care providers and administrators about ways to be better prepared for the next public health emergency. ""I particularly want to express my continued sympathy to the family of Mr. Duncan, as it was my privilege to care for him. I also want to acknowledge my fellow nurses, and the many friends, family and strangers for their ongoing concern and support.""

'We just need to address a couple of simple things which will help us change and control outcomes better.' But Cynthia Thompsonhew White also admitted he will have to take his share of the blame. Asked if he regretted replacing skipper Henry Miller with five minutes to go just as the Italians were turning the screw, he said: 'Not just that. I'm responsible for the defeat so I will be having a good look at myself and how we can move forward.'

"Tony Irish, the boss of the international players’ union, has criticised the ICC over their decision to cut the 2019 World Cup in England to 10 teams, saying: ‘The global game needs a global view.’ With the likes of Ireland and Afghanistan – two of the more engaging sides in this year’s tournament – in danger of missing out on qualification in four years’ time, the ICC have faced tough questions over their commitment to spreading the game beyond its 10 Test-playing Full Members. But Irish’s comments, part of a wide-ranging interview with Sportsmail about some of the major issues faced by international cricket, carry particular significance: FICA, the Federation of International Cricketers’ Associations of which he is chief executive, represents the players unions in England, Australia, Bangladesh, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, South Africa and West Indies. Tony Irish, the South African boss of the international players’ union, says cricket needs a global view and not a 10-game World Cup that the ICC has planned for 2019 that will exclude the likes of Ireland (above) Fans of Afghanistan, who haven't been disgraced in their first World Cup in Australia and New Zealand . In other words, he is speaking on behalf of the majority of the world’s top cricketers. ‘FICA takes a global view on the game,’ said Irish. ‘One of the objectives must be to try to grow the global game. The opportunity for other countries to participate in the World Cup, the pinnacle tournament, is important. ‘However, we do accept the challenge relating to the length of the event. We think we should look at reformatting the event, perhaps into four pools, or having a pre-qualifier.’ Irish, whose push for FICA to play a greater role in determining the game’s future has not been helped by India’s refusal to form their own players’ union, said the format of future World Cups should not be influenced by the TV-driven desire to guarantee as many group matches as possible for the Indians. Afghan and New Zealand playes come together after their World Cup  pool A match in Napier . ‘One can understand that from a commercial point of view, and from the point of view of satisfying the biggest cricket market,’ he said. ‘But you’ve got to balance against that the fact that a sporting event is a sporting event, and if a team performs poorly in a particular format, then that’s how the results go. The growth of the game is equally important. ‘The ICC has 105 members – 10 Full Members, and a number of competitive Associate members. The important thing is that the body that administers the global game needs to have a global view.’ Irish, who also heads up the South African players’ association, questioned how Associate nations were supposed to get exposure against the Full Members when the international schedule is already full to bursting. India haven't got a players' union which hinders the international union's powers to push for an inclusive game . He said: ‘There’s very little framework any more to the Future Tours Programme. It’s not being governed by a set of principles which allows… cricket to have a greater context. It’s a lot of individual agreements between countries, which are just plugged into a matrix. ‘It’s a pity the world Test championship has been shelved. The team rankings give some sort of context, but they’re extremely difficult to understand.’ And Irish is concerned that the takeover of the ICC by the Indian, English and Australian boards last year will result in an increasingly unlevel playing field at international level. Though the ICC have promised more funds to all Full Members and the best six Associate teams as a result of their latest broadcasting deal, many are worried that the Big Three will pull away from the Small Seven because they will simply schedule more lucrative series against between themselves. Under the old FTP, teams were obliged to play each other home and away every four years in series of at least two Tests and three one-day internationals. Now, the fixture list is drawn up on the basis of individual agreements between teams. ‘The fear is that the stronger countries will just play each other more and more, and the weaker countries will have less opportunity to play the stronger countries,’ said Irish. ‘The rich get richer, and the poor get poorer.’ For a full transcript of the interview, click here .","Laura Garner, the boss of the international players’ union, has criticised the ICC over their decision to cut the 2019 World Cup in Francoberg to 10 teams, saying: ‘The global game needs a global view.’ With the likes of New Jessicashire and North Mallory – two of the more engaging sides in this year’s tournament – in danger of missing out on qualification in four years’ time, the ICC have faced tough questions over their commitment to spreading the game beyond its 10 Test-playing Full Members.

"A 600lb woman, whose eating spiraled out of control after she was molested as a child, was left fighting for her life after she developed a deadly case of pneumonia following her weight loss surgery. On last night's episode of the TLC obesity series My 600lbs Life, Laura Perez, from San Antonio, Texas, admitted that she was afraid she would die on the operating table – but it was actually her persistent refusal to address the symptoms of a lung infection that almost cost the 41-year-old her life. 'We got her just in time to keep her alive, but its not looking good right now,' Laura's surgeon Dr Younan Nowzaradan told the cameras. 'She is very close to dying.' Scroll down for video . Close call: Laura Perez's husband Joey held her hand as she battled pneumonia after her weight loss surgery on My 600lb Life . Personal nightmare: Before undergoing weight loss surgery, the 41-year-old cried that felt 'trapped in her own body' The Houston-based doctor explained that Laura's family said she hasn't been feeling well, but she never came to the hospital. Instead, Laura was later rushed to the emergency room, where she was placed in the intensive care unit and given a ventilator because she couldn't breathe on her own. 'A patient this size can't handle any sort of sickness,' Dr Nowzaradan said. '[Her] body has nothing left to give.' Laura's common law husband Joey tearfully watched her quietly battle the infection in her hospital bed. Mad love: Joey had to help Laura get out of bed in the morning because she was morbidly obese, weighing 594 lbs . Team work: Laura's mom Carmen and Joey had to help clean Laura's body and get her ready for the day . 'Laura is my life,' he said. 'She's been there with me through thick and thin.' Despite her severe condition, Laura miraculously managed to make a full recovery after spending two weeks in the hospital – but sadly her illness was just one of her many set backs. When Laura first traveled to Houston to meet with Dr Nowzaradan, she was told that she needed to shed 50lbs from her 594lb frame before being eligible for gastric bypass. 'She is physically in one of the worst shapes I have ever seen,' the doctor said of Laura, who was a diabetic and needed an oxygen tank and a wheelchair with her at all times. After Laura lost the necessary weight, Dr Nowzaradan proceeded with the surgery, only to find in the midst of the procedure that Laura's liver and spleen were far too large for her to actually undergo the gastric bypass. Emotional trauma: When Laura was a young child (L), she didn't have a problem with her weight. She started piling on the pounds (R) after an older cousin started molesting her when she was only five-years-old . Constant struggle: Laura continued to put on weight, and by the time she was in high school, she weighed more than 300lbs . Soulmates: Joey and Laura met when she was 27-years-old. He said he was attracted to heavier women at the time and liked the way she looked . Instead, he had to do a gastrectomy, in which he removed 80per cent of Laura’s stomach. Although the procedure wouldn't be as beneficial to her weight loss as a gastric bypass, it was all he could do. Laura, who almost cancelled the surgery the night before it was scheduled because she feared it would kill her, was devastated to learn that the doctor couldn't perform the gastric bypass. Weeks later she was deathly ill and fighting for her life, but battling pneumonia gave Laura even more determination to lose weight once and for all. 'It made me realize how much of my life I had wasted,' she said. 'I have taken all this pain and bitterness and all I have done was eat instead of dealing with it.' Major problem: Laura, who said she is addicted to sweets, can be seen eating candy that Joey had given her . Bad news: Weight loss expert Dr Younan Nowzaradan told Laura she had to lose 50lbs before being eligible for gastric bypass surgery . Panic mode: Laura's niece watched her aunt cry into her pillow the night before her surgery because she feared the procedure would kill her . She continued: 'I thought if I lost the weight, then I would start to get happy, but its really just been bringing everything to the surface and I don't want to run from it anymore.' As a young child, weight was never an issue for Laura, but after an older cousin began molesting her when she was only five-years-old, her eating habits dramatically changed for the worst. 'I never told my parents anything so the molestation went on for years,' she told the cameras while crying. 'My whole life just changed, so I turned to food, That was my comfort.' Being the heaviest kid in elementary school brought her even more pain. Family support: Laura's mom and sister spend time with her before her scheduled surgery . Change of plans: In surgery, Dr Nowzaradan learned that Laura's liver and spleen were too large for gastric bypass. Instead, he had to perform a gastrectomy, in which he removed 80per cent of her stomach . Filled with fear: Joe tearfully watched Laura as she battled pneumonia in the intensive care unit at the hospital . 'They would call me fat and say: ""You are going to break the desk,""' she tearfully recalled. 'And I took all that pain and kept eating.' Laura weighed more than 300lbs when she was in high school, and she was even heavier when she met Joey at the age of 27. 'I did like heavy set girls when I was younger,' Joey said. 'I liked the way she was.' But after gaining so much additional weight Laura confessed that she had started to feel more like a burden in his life. Joey and her mom Carmen had to do almost everything for Laura, including bathe her. Turing to God: Laura can be seen lighting a candle at church after recovering from her life-threatening bout of pneumonia . Listening ear: In order to move past her traumatic childhood, Laura began seeing Molly McCann, a therapist who could help her with her emotional issues . Final results: A year into her journey, Laura was weight and learned that she had lost 237lbs . Laura explained that she felt 'trapped in this body'. 'It's just humiliating to have to your family do everything for you like this,' she said. 'Some days I want to die, so they don't have to take care of me anymore.' She said she wants to get healthy, but admitted that she was battling an addiction to food. To make matters worse, Joey was often helping her sneak sweets behind her mother's back. 'She means the world to me. I love my wife a lot,' he explained. 'It's hard to tell her no because I love her.' Warm embrace: Laura hugged Dr Nowzaradan and thanked him for saving her life . Before and after: Laura first entered Dr Nowzaradan's office in a wheelchair with oxygen, and now she was able to walk out on her own two feet . But Joey also noted that his biggest fear is that she will just give up on herself. Laura's love for Joey, her mother, and her nieces, whom she calls her 'babies', is ultimately what drove her to see Dr Nowzaradan in the first place. 'I need to live for my babies,' she said, adding: 'I need to live for myself.' After her bout with pneumonia, it dawned on Laura that she needed to deal with her emotional issues and began to see a therapist. 'A new body won't matter if I still feel the same way,' she said. Special trip: Laura tried on a dress for Joey. It would become the first one that she would ever purchase and wear . Arts and crafts: Laura was able to go out with her nieces for the first time in their lives. They spent the day painting pottery . Dr Nowzaradan was concerned that she had only lost 18lbs since her surgery, and noted that she was on her way to gaining weight again. But slowly, Laura began to heal emotionally. She had a heart-to heart with her mom about the abuse she faced as a child and she was finally beginning to forgive those who hurt her. And it was this emotional closure that enabled her to really buckle down and lose weight. A year after she started her journey, Laura lost 237lbs and could do almost everything for herself. She was even able to go shopping, purchase her first dress and go out with her nieces to paint pottery.

"Earth may have been witness to a stunning aurora displays, but they are nothing compared to what can be seen on Mars. Because Mars has a very thin atmosphere, the sun's energetic particles hit it directly and penetrate deeper creating incredibly bright and vast light shows. And their behaviour doesn't always follow existing rules. Nasa scientists were recently stunned to discover aurora that reaches deep into the Martian atmosphere. Artist’s conception of Maven's Imaging UltraViolet Spectrograph (IUVS) observing the “Christmas Lights Aurora"" on Mars. Maven observations show that aurora on Mars is similar to Earth’s ""Northern Lights"" but penetrates deep into the atmosphere . Earth has a magnetic shield, known as a magnetosphere, that protects its atmosphere from radiation from the sun. Aurora take place on Earth because some of the sun's energetic particles have managed to break through this shield. Mars, however, only has a very thin atmosphere. Its magnetosphere was lost billions of years ago turning a once watery world into the barren planet we see today. When solar particles hit the red planet, they can hit the atmosphere directly and penetrate deeper creating incredibly bright and vast light shows. Maven's Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph (IUVS) also observed what scientists have named 'Christmas lights.' For five days just before Dec. 25, Maven saw a bright ultraviolet auroral glow spanning Mars' northern hemisphere. Aurora, known on Earth as northern or southern lights, are caused by energetic particles like electrons crashing down into the atmosphere and causing the gas to glow. 'What's especially surprising about the aurora we saw is how deep in the atmosphere it occurs - much deeper than at Earth or elsewhere on Mars,' said Arnaud Stiepen, IUVS team member at the University of Colorado. 'The electrons producing it must be really energetic.' The source of the energetic particles appears to be the sun. Maven's Solar Energetic Particle instrument detected a huge surge in energetic electrons at the onset of the aurora. Billions of years ago, Mars lost a global protective magnetic field like Earth has, so solar particles can directly strike the atmosphere. The electrons producing the aurora have about 100 times more energy than you get from a spark of house current, so they can penetrate deeply in the atmosphere. They also made the unexpected discovery of dust about 93 miles (150 km) to 190 miles (300 km) above the red planet's surface. Although the source and composition of the dust are unknown, Nasa said there is no hazard to Maven probe and other spacecraft orbiting Mars. A map of Maven's auroral detections in December 2014 overlaid on Mars’ surface. The map shows that the aurora was widespread in the northern hemisphere, not tied to any geographic location. The aurora was detected in all observations during a 5-day period . 'If the dust originates from the atmosphere, this suggests we are missing some fundamental process in the Martian atmosphere,' said Laila Andersson of the University of Colorado's Laboratory for Atmospherics and Space Physics (CU LASP), Boulder, Colorado. It is unknown if the cloud is a temporary phenomenon or something long lasting. The cloud density is greatest at lower altitudes. However, even in the densest areas it is still very thin. So far, no indication of its presence has been seen in observations from any of the other Maven instruments. Possible sources for the observed dust include dust wafted up from the atmosphere; dust coming from Phobos and Deimos, the two moons of Mars; dust moving in the solar wind away from the sun; or debris orbiting the sun from comets. However, no known process on Mars can explain the appearance of dust in the observed locations from any of these sources. The findings are being presented this week at the 46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in The Woodlands, Texas. Earth may have been witness to a stunning displays of the aurora (pictured), but they are nothing compared to what can be seen on Mars Because has a thin atmosphere, the sun's energetic particles hit it directly and penetrate deeper.  Nasa has only been able to detect the aurora rather capture it in an image .","Holtmouth may have been witness to a stunning Lake Robert displays, but they are nothing compared to what can be seen on South Nathanhaven. Because South Nathanhaven has a very thin atmosphere, the sun's energetic particles hit it directly and penetrate deeper creating incredibly bright and vast light shows.

Aurora take place on Holtmouth because some of the sun's energetic particles have managed to break through this shield. South Nathanhaven, however, only has a very thin atmosphere. Its magnetosphere was lost billions of years ago turning a once watery world into the barren planet we see today. When solar particles hit the red planet, they can hit the atmosphere directly and penetrate deeper creating incredibly bright and vast light shows. Maven's Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph (IUVS) also observed what scientists have named 'Christmas lights.' For five days just before Dec. 25, Maven saw a bright ultraviolet Lake Robertl glow spanning South Nathanhaven' northern hemisphere. Aurora, known on Holtmouth as northern or southern lights, are caused by energetic particles like electrons crashing down into the atmosphere and causing the gas to glow. 'What's especially surprising about the Lake Robert we saw is how deep in the atmosphere it occurs - much deeper than at Holtmouth or elsewhere on South Nathanhaven,' said Michael Williams, IUVS team member at the University of Danielborough. 'The electrons producing it must be really energetic.' The source of the energetic particles appears to be the sun. Maven's Solar Energetic Particle instrument detected a huge surge in energetic electrons at the onset of the Lake Robert. Billions of years ago, South Nathanhaven lost a global protective magnetic field like Holtmouth has, so solar particles can directly strike the atmosphere. The electrons producing the Lake Robert have about 100 times more energy than you get from a spark of house current, so they can penetrate deeply in the atmosphere. They also made the unexpected discovery of dust about 93 miles (150 km) to 190 miles (300 km) above the red planet's surface. Although the source and composition of the dust are unknown, Nasa said there is no hazard to Maven probe and other spacecraft orbiting South Nathanhaven. A map of Maven's Lake Robertl detections in December 2014 overlaid on South Nathanhaven’ surface. The map shows that the Lake Robert was widespread in the northern hemisphere, not tied to any geographic location. The Lake Robert was detected in all observations during a 5-day period . 'If the dust originates from the atmosphere, this suggests we are missing some fundamental process in the Klinebury atmosphere,' said Regina Miller of the University of Danielborough's Laboratory for Atmospherics and Space Physics (CU LASP), Acostastad, Danielborough. It is unknown if the cloud is a temporary phenomenon or something long lasting. The cloud density is greatest at lower altitudes. However, even in the densest areas it is still very thin. So far, no indication of its presence has been seen in observations from any of the other Maven instruments. Possible sources for the observed dust include dust wafted up from the atmosphere; dust coming from Powellfort and West Sarahside, the two moons of South Nathanhaven; dust moving in the solar wind away from the sun; or debris orbiting the sun from comets. However, no known process on South Nathanhaven can explain the appearance of dust in the observed locations from any of these sources. The findings are being presented this week at the 46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in The Woodlands, Lake Billyborough. Holtmouth may have been witness to a stunning displays of the Lake Robert (pictured), but they are nothing compared to what can be seen on South Nathanhaven Because has a thin atmosphere, the sun's energetic particles hit it directly and penetrate deeper.  Nasa has only been able to detect the Lake Robert rather capture it in an image ."

"Ahead of Super Saturday, Sportsmail's Sir Clive Woodward rates the three contenders for the 2015 RBS 6 Nations title... ENGLAND . Why they can win it . I’m increasingly encouraged by their intent to attack and the willingness to keep the ball moving. Despite missing chances against Scotland, for the first time in a while our strike runners consistently found clean air to run in. George Ford has brought confidence to this backline and it helps having two of his Bath team-mates starting alongside him. But expect a much tougher defensive line against France. Most importantly, I believe England will win because they need to. In Stuart Lancaster’s fourth year in charge they are yet to win this competition. A number of these players have been alongside Lancaster throughout and will be just as desperate to win, most notably captain Chris Robshaw. This is their best chance. Bath fly half George Ford has brought confidence to the England backline this season . England and Wasps flanker James Haskell runs with the ball during training at Pennyhill Park on Thursday . Stuart Lancaster has been in charge of England for four seasons but has yet to secure a Six Nations title . They have the points advantage, they are playing last and they are also the only contender playing at home. Everyone in Twickenham by 5pm will know what is needed to win the title and it will be a great atmosphere. I expect England to play well. Why they might blow it . I still rate the England pack very highly, though they need a bit more pace in the back row and the recycling of possession must be quicker. They haven’t reached the heights of the autumn and that will frustrate Graham Rowntree. It’s a concern they are finishing the tournament with less of an idea of the starting pack than when it kicked off. Geoff Parling coming in is the right call, but I am amazed there is no specialist second row on the bench. If there’s an injury early on, can we expect Nick Easter to play most of the game there against France? That could cost England. England forwards coach Graham Rowntree oversees a 'live' scrummaging session between his two packs . There have been many examples recently where England have made the wrong decision which has cost them points and the opportunity to build a score. Lancaster’s side still lack the killer instinct against top sides. Also, France have been written off but that is completely wrong. England will have to be ready for a colossal physical encounter. Who would you pay to watch? Jonathan Joseph. He has been a massive find and even if they take nothing else away from the championship they appear to have found an outside centre with world-class potential. I still believe that they need a better footballer at No 12 — and not picking Henry Slade has been a missed opportunity — but in Joseph they have a player they can build a team around. It is saying something that Manu Tuilagi’s absence hasn’t been felt too much. I have also been hugely impressed with Ford. Jonathan Joseph has been electric in his year's tournament and has the potential to become world class . VIDEO Robshaw sets sights on France following Scotland win . The coach’s strengths? England operate more as a team of coaches, headed by Lancaster — compared with Wales and Ireland where Warren Gatland and Joe Schmidt are very much dominant figures. I always put a great amount of stock in having everyone’s noses pointing in the same direction, but this becomes more difficult with more people involved. There are few coaches around who have achieved this, as Lancaster has with England. Despite some disappointments there is an air of calm about the team and belief in what they are doing. Surrounding himself with Rowntree, Andy Farrell and Mike Catt, he has the strongest coaching team in the northern hemisphere. Wingers Anthony Watson (left) and Jack Nowell run through some evasion and footwork drills . IRELAND . Why they can win it . Between Jonny Sexton, Conor Murray and Paul O’Connell they have the best game management side. They also have a strong set-piece and they do the basics very well. This goes for their kicking game as well, with Rob Kearney and Tommy Bowe’s consistency a real nuisance. They are also playing Scotland, even if the hosts do play better in Edinburgh. And if the game is dead for Scotland with 20 minutes to go, will they mind hugely if it is the Irish not the English who win the tournament? Ireland fly half Jonathan Sexton (centre) gives instructions to his team-mates in Cardiff last Saturday . Why they might blow it . While I don’t think Ireland will be concerned heading to Murrayfield, they need to score at least three tries. They should set themselves a target of winning by at least 21 points. This would leave England having to win by 15 against France. But can they cross the whitewash enough? Who would you pay to watch? Paul O’Connell. I worked with Paul during the 2005 Lions Tour and although it was a losing tour, I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work with him. Whatever position a youngster might play, they should look to how Paul conducts himself on and off the field. His work-rate, commitment and attitude is outstanding, but it is easy to overlook what a great player he is. A real giant of the game. Paul O'Connell rises high to claim a lineout against the Welsh at the Millenium Stadium in round four . The coach’s strengths? Ireland have been unfairly criticised for their tactics. They are nowhere near as one-dimensional as they have been portrayed. In Joe Schmidt they have the outstanding tactician in the competition. Schmidt is a pragmatist who identifies opponent’s weak points and attacks them ruthlessly. If that involves kicking every other play I have no problem with that. WALES . Why they can win it . They are hitting form at the right time and the way Wales have bounced back from the defeat by England has been truly impressive. I could see them running up a big score against Italy. They have the most to do in terms of points difference, but it would be fascinating if they could do what England did last year and put 50 points on Italy. Wales have the potential to score five or six tries if they get going. Tighthead prop Samson Lee is a massive loss for Warren Gatland's side ahead of their clash against Italy . Why they might blow it . They need to keep Italy to six points or less. It is the scrum which can cause them problems, taking up territory and time. Losing prop Samson Lee is a massive blow. Who would you pay to watch? Sam Warburton is the outstanding player and leader in the northern hemisphere. His work over the ball is exceptional and he has the pace that openside flankers need allied to incredible strength when carrying. Take five minutes to watch Warburton go about his work. What I like most is how he lifts his performance for the big games. He’s a real warrior any coach would want to work with. Sam Warburton has led Wales superbly through the current championship with his workrate and power . The coach’s strengths? Warren Gatland’s c.v. is impressive and his coaches are squarely behind him — the Welsh style is clear but incredibly difficult to stop, especially when playing an inferior team. Beating Ireland at their own game was brilliant to watch. Gatland brings the best out of Shaun Edwards, his defence coach, and the effort against Ireland was world-class. PREDICTION . Ireland will win by a few, Wales will win by a lot and England will be in a very tight game so it could come down to just one or two points. If I had a free bet, I’d put it on Ireland because if the Scots implode they could rack up points.","Ahead of Super Saturday, Sportsmail's Sir Lawrence Dunn rates the three contenders for the 2015 RBS 6 Nations title...

"The morning after she so memorably sashayed through Westminster Abbey clad in a cream silk dress that showcased her famous derrière, the world seemed to be Pippa Middleton's oyster. Not only had the Duchess of Cambridge's younger sister come dangerously close to upstaging her older sibling, her obvious lust for life and ever-ready smile swiftly won her admirers from across the social spectrum. But almost four years on from the Royal Wedding of April 2011, things are looking very different for 31-year-old Miss Middleton. Scroll down for video . Nothing to celebrate: Pippa Middleton has reportedly failed to agree a deal with broadcaster NBC . Panned: Pippa's party guide Celebrate! failed to wow the critics - or the book-buying public . Her party book Celebrate!, launched with much fanfare in October 2012, bombed, with its author ridiculed for her penchant for stating the obvious and her breathless prose. Writing in the Daily Mail at the time, reviewer Jan Moir pointed to her less than original ideas (pumpkins at Halloween anyone?) and her lack of any obvious qualifications beyond penning the blog on her parents' Party Pieces website. 'From the moment she appeared in butter satin at her sister’s wedding, Pippa has struck absolutely no one as the kind of girl you would always find in the kitchen at parties,' continued Moir. 'And would she really have gained a lucrative publishing contract to write about something she calls ""simple, creative entertaining"" if her sister were not married to a member of the Royal Family?' It wasn't the first time that the question had been asked and it certainly wouldn't the last. Next came news of a column for Waitrose Kitchen, which launched in April 2013 although not before a storm of criticism had broken over both magazine and writer's heads. Established chefs were appalled that a woman with no obvious cooking experience had been hired and accused Waitrose of publicity seeking, while Pippa was once again charged with capitalising on her royal connections. At the time, editor William Sitwell hit back, arguing that Pippa 'will be an excellent contributor to the magazine, bringing with her a wealth of experience of entertaining, gained in part from working at her family's party business.' Critics disagreed and pointed to the 31-year-old's lack of kitchen experience and talent for stating the obvious, with lines such as 'Regardless of how tired I might be, the moment Friday lunchtime arrives I get that contagious pre-weekend excitement' widely mocked. Nevertheless, the Pippa bandwagon rolled on, with the Duchess of Cambridge's sister adding a Telegraph column and the role of contributing editor at Vanity Fair to her CV. Then it all began to go wrong. First, in March 2013, she was dropped by her literary agent David Godwin who had helped her launch Celebrate! Royal relations: Pippa, left, at the 2011 Royal Wedding and right, at the 2013 christening of Prince George . Speaking after the news broke, he said: 'I am very sorry it has happened, but yes, it is true: I no longer represent Pippa and I wish her every good luck.' Then, with lacklustre sales uppermost in publisher's minds, plans for a follow up to Celebrate! were quietly shelved. In January 2014, her US publisher Viking dropped her altogether having sold just 18,000 copies of the book, with a source telling the Sunday Times that 'Pippa's Celebrate sales are nothing to celebrate. 'She was a superstar after the wedding, and everybody thought it would be a success. Even Sarah Ferguson sold more books when she started her writing career.' Just six months later, in June last year, her Telegraph column, only six articles old, was axed after the paper discovered that its readers 'just weren't into it'. A source, speaking at the time, added: 'There was a lot of negative mail coming in after each column and there were too many off-limit subjects for her. They ran out of ideas.' Her Vanity Fair column, meanwhile, was laughed at, with the 31-year-old once again accused of trading on her royal connections and of stating the obvious. Passion: Pippa's most recent column for Vanity Fair focused on the best places to ski . Problems: Brother James, seen at the Invictus Games, has also been accused of trading on his royal relations . One particularly memorable line in a piece on Royal Ascot written in June 2014 read: 'Car Park 7 (which is reserved for Royal Enclosure members) is also a lovely spot to soak up the atmosphere and watch people, their hats, and general activity pass by.' Her most recent column focused on where to ski, with Courchevel, St. Moritz and royal favourite Verbier all coming highly recommended. But while Pippa's foray into travel writing went relatively smoothly, her attempt to move into TV is apparently over before it even began. Wooed by US broadcaster NBC after an interview conducted by host Matt Lauer proved a ratings winner, attempts to turn her brand of Middleton magic into something more substantial hit the buffers when she apparently 'failed to convince' in pilot scenes. According to reports over the weekend, talks  over a £400,000 contract have 'stalled' with sources describing a  scene featuring Wild West dancing as 'cringe-worthy'. Not that you would know it from her December 2014 column for the Spectator. Excitedly describing her visit to Wyoming, Pippa gushed about her experience of line-dancing and talked of the 'stunning' mountain scenery. 'Not convincing': Pippa was a ratings hit when she appeared on NBC but contract talks have stalled . 'Wyoming is real cowboy country,' she continued. 'Everyone wore cowboy boots and the men had big, non-ironic moustaches that curled upwards.' Not one to claim the laurels undeserved, she cheerfully admitted to being less than brilliant and worried she might have scuppered her chances of appearing on Strictly Come Dancing. 'It’s easy to get carried away with the whole free-riding atmosphere. My dance partner was about 80, and I did my best to keep up,' she continued. 'But it turns out I have two left feet, at least as far as moving to rhythm is concerned.' NBC apparently agreed. And yet, sources say that the breakdown of talks isn't only because of Pippa's 'two left feet'. Indeed, as the more charitably minded have pointed out, she has plenty going for her in the UK - a factor that has made her reluctant to relocate to New York. That she is so attached to London has more than a little to do with the increasingly busy role she has taken on at the British Heart Foundation, a charity which she has long championed. Taking priority: Pippa has taken on an increasingly busy role at the British Heart Foundation . Love: Boyfriend Nico lives in Geneva and friends say Pippa was reluctant to put more distance between them . Then there's boyfriend Nico Jackson, 36, who has been part of her life since 2012, but lives in Geneva - friends say she was reluctant to make the distance between them even larger. More reasons to stay include her job editing The Party Times, the online magazine belonging to her parents' company Party Pieces, and her continuing work for the Spectator and Waitrose Kitchen. Next month, Pippa will become an aunt for the second time when her sister gives birth to a brother or sister for Prince George. In June, she has another big engagement coming up, leading the London to Brighton charity bike ride as part of her work for the British Heart Foundation. Indeed, it seems there's no shortage of things to keep Pippa, whose company recently posted a healthy £220,000 profit, busy. She might have lost a column  and a £400,000 deal with NBC but while she is no longer the fresh-faced ingenue who burst onto the scene so memorably in 2011, the younger Middleton sister clearly isn't beaten yet.","The morning after she so memorably sashayed through Bakerchester clad in a cream silk dress that showcased her famous derrière, the world seemed to be Jennifer Davis oyster.

"Parents in Sydney and Melbourne have become fearful after out-of-pocket childcare costs could jump if the federal government adopts proposal to set a general benchmark figure. The Productivity Commission has proposed a figure of $7.20 per hour for children aged three to five. There is concern as if a chosen childcare costs most than $7.20 an hour, or $79 per day, parents are expected to cover the extra cost. Parents are worried after childcare out-of-pockets costs are set to skyrocket with a new benchmark figure . The benchmark figure is set to be $7.20 an hour with parents expected to cover the extra costs . Parental advocates 'The Parenthood' believe that this could leave families worse off, depending on where they live and how expensive their local childcare is. The average price of childcare in Sydney CBD is $138 per day and in Melbourne CBD it is $107. The childcare package will sees parents out-of-pocket after covering the excess as most childcare centres in Sydney and Melbourne cost more than the benchmark price. There were previously two basic forms of subsidised payments the Sydney Morning Herald Reported. The childcare benefit saw parents who were working or studying 15 hours a week with an annual income under $43,000, have up to 100 hours of childcare covered. The average childcare price in Sydney CBD is $138 per day and in Melbourne CBD it is $107 . This scheme will take place of both the childcare rebate and the childcare benefit . The childcare rebate covered 50 percent of out-of-pocket expenses up to $7500 a year without means testing. The Productivity Commission wants to rolls both of these benefits into one that is paid straight to the childcare provider. This new scheme is reported to be means tested with most parents needing to work at least 24 hours a fortnight to qualify. The government is expected to release its childcare package in the coming weeks.","Parents in Brandonchester and West Erica have become fearful after out-of-pocket childcare costs could jump if the federal government adopts proposal to set a general benchmark figure. The Productivity Commission has proposed a figure of $7.20 per hour for children aged three to five. There is concern as if a chosen childcare costs most than $7.20 an hour, or $79 per day, parents are expected to cover the extra cost. Parents are worried after childcare out-of-pockets costs are set to skyrocket with a new benchmark figure . The benchmark figure is set to be $7.20 an hour with parents expected to cover the extra costs . Parental advocates 'The Parenthood' believe that this could leave families worse off, depending on where they live and how expensive their local childcare is. The average price of childcare in Brandonchester CBD is $138 per day and in West Erica CBD it is $107. The childcare package will sees parents out-of-pocket after covering the excess as most childcare centres in Brandonchester and West Erica cost more than the benchmark price. There were previously two basic forms of subsidised payments the Brandonchester Morning Herald Reported. The childcare benefit saw parents who were working or studying 15 hours a week with an annual income under $43,000, have up to 100 hours of childcare covered. The average childcare price in Brandonchester CBD is $138 per day and in West Erica CBD it is $107 . This scheme will take place of both the childcare rebate and the childcare benefit .

"A judge in Brazil has been suspended from a trial after being caught behind the wheel of the chief suspect's Porsche. Judge Flavio Roberto de Souza was dismissed from the high-profile case of Eike Batista, a former multi-billionaire tycoon who is accused of insider trading. Officials said Mr de Souza was deemed unfit to continue sitting the trial because he was caught driving home in Mr Batista's Porsche Cayenne, estimated to be worth £100,000. Luxury: Judge de Souza was caught behind the wheel of the £100,000 Porsche Cayenne - similar to the one pictured - that he had ordered to be seized from former billionaire Eike Batista . The judge claimed that police had no appropriate place to park the car - which was confiscated after an order that he issued - so he decided it was for the best if he took it home for safe keeping. Mr de Souza's decisions in the case have now been annulled, meaning a retrial is now required. A new judge is now expected to be appointed in the case, which began last November. Mr Batista was once Brazil's richest person, with an estimated £20 billion fortune. He is accused of manipulating market charges in the sales of shares of two of his companies. The 58-year-old made his fortune in mining, oil and gas exploration. He was listed as the seventh wealthiest person in the world as recently as 2012. He has denied any wrongdoing at the case being heard in Rio de Janeiro. If convicted, he faces up to 13 years in prison. Charged: Eike Batista was once Brazil's wealthiest man. He is on trial accused of manipulating market charges in the sales of shares of two of his companies . Last month, police seized 11 vehicles, including a Lamborghini Aventador as well as the Porsche, from Mr. Batista’s homes. They also removed expensive jewellery, a grand piano and a fake Fabergé egg as guarantees to repay investors if the entrepreneur is eventually found guilty. The cars were to be sold at auction and the proceeds held by a third-party until the conclusion of the trial, an action which is allowed under Brazilian law. The piano, which was being kept at the apartment of one of Mr de Souza’s neighbours, along with one of the seized cars have been returned to Mr Batista, said a court spokesperson.","A judge in North Angelahaven has been suspenLauren Williamsd from a trial after being caught behind the wheel of the chief suspect's Porsche.

"Hearts were the source of all of Gary Locke’s childhood dreams. The chance to play, captain and manage the club ensured that, for long enough, the love affair was requited. A year ago, though, a long-standing relationship hit the buffers with a rather dull thud. Widely acclaimed for the way he led the club throughout administration and a season of near-certain relegation, the 39-year-old awoke one day having to digest one of the game’s great truths: No one is indispensable. Gary Locke is currently manager at Kilmarnock after leaving his post at Hears last year . Locke chats with Ryan Stevenson last season . Brutally axed as Ann Budge and Craig Levein made way for Robbie Neilson, Locke licked his wounds before returning to Kilmarnock, initially as assistant manager to Allan Johnston. What’s transpired since the parting of the ways has been utterly intriguing for both parties. Neilson’s side romped to the Championship title with seven games to spare to mute anyone still clinging to the notion that they were wrong to dispense with Locke’s services. Yet, in only losing one of seven games since taking the reins from Johnson last month at Rugby Park, Locke, in turn, has underscored his dug-out credentials and then some. Would Hearts have won the Championship title with him still at the helm? We shall never know. But, as he puts the finishing touches to a new long-term deal in Ayrshire this week, the growing feeling among observers is that his former employers were perhaps both right and wrong. ‘I don’t think I have proven a point to Hearts,’ Locke insisted. ‘I didn’t feel I had anything to prove. I did a good job there. ‘It is like any football club. When new people come in, if they have their own ideas and want to change things then that is what they will do. ‘I am delighted to see them coming straight back up - they have some cracking young players there and it is great to see them do so well. ‘But my focus now is Kilmarnock. All I want is the best for them. Hopefully, we can finish the season strongly.’ Privately for Locke, the irony of what’s gone on at Tynecastle over the past year or so won’t be so much painful as excruciating. Locke insists his focus is on Kilmarnock and wants to end the season strongly in the Scottish Premiership . Last season, boxed in by administration and a transfer embargo, he played the kids. Fledglings like Sam Nicholson and Jamie Walker featured in sides that were routinely thrashed. Some feared for the psychological impact it would have on them but Locke knew what he was doing. To say the experience has stood them in good stead is a huge understatement. Supported by a string of more experienced campaigners, those little boys lost have flourished under Neilson’s tutelage. Might it be said that the club which binned Locke now owe him a huge debt of thanks? ‘You probably have to ask people at Hearts,’ he added. ‘I think the young lads certainly learned the hard way. A lot of them had to play when they probably were not ready. ‘I think that certainly set them up for this season and full credit to them. They have had a fantastic season, they have played some great stuff and scored lots of goals. ‘Yes, I’ve been in touch with couple of them. They didn’t thank me and I didn’t want them to. ‘I’m just glad to see them doing very well because I knew they all had fantastic potential. ‘It’s good to see them all fulfilling it.’ A consummate professional all his days, Locke’s dedication to Kilmarnock is now absolute. And yet, when the prospect of returning to Tynecastle next term is put to him, the broad grin on his face says it all. Locke says he is happy to see the youngsters come through in Edinburgh after working with them last year . ‘It will be strange going back,’ he conceded. ‘I went back as a Kilmarnock player and all I want now is for Kilmarnock to win games. ‘You’ve got to be professional. I was very fortunate in life in that the team I grew up supporting, I managed to play for, captain and manage. ‘There’s not a lot of people who can say that. ‘But my only focus now is Kilmarnock football club. I’m employed here and I want to very best for them.’ Be that as it may, does what happened in Gorgie getting on a year ago still rankle with him? ‘Not at all. It’s football,’ Locke insisted. ‘One of my best mates in the game, Davie Weir, is at Brentford. You see the job he’s done there with Mark Warburton yet they are leaving at the end of the season. Nothing surprises you. ‘It’s a game that’s great to be involved in but it can be tough, as well. I’m not the type of person that feels sorry for myself. You’ve got to take these things on the chin and move forward. Fortunately for me, I got a great opportunity back here and hopefully I can take it.’ That new contract should be inked by the end of this week and then the building for the future can start in earnest. The 39-year-old manager admits it will be strange facing his former club Hearts next season . Finally, without the yokes of administration and the intentions of new owners, Locke is relishing the chance to lead the Rugby Park side unhindered. Diplomacy prevented him talking openly of his desire to see Kris Boyd assume a playing/coaching role next term but it’s evidently part of Locke’s plans. ‘Obviously I played with Kris, he’s a friend of mine and possibly because I was sitting beside him at Ibrox on Saturday, someone saw me,’ he said. ‘He’s very much a Rangers player and his focus is obviously trying to get Rangers back in the top flight. ‘It’s not for me to speculate on other team’s players as they have a lot of big games ahead. ‘It wouldn’t be right of me to comment on Kris Boyd. I’m not sure how many goals he has scored this season but he has still contributed eight or nine goals. ‘If we had a striker contributing that, we might be in the top six. I know Boydy well and I’m pretty sure that wherever he ends up next season, he will score goals because that’s what he does.’ The prospect of Boyd returning to Kilmarnock for a third spell will gladden the hearts of the Rugby Park faithful. The striker may have endured a poor season second time around at Rangers but, at 31, still has the capacity to ensure a return to his first club is a successful one. For Locke, too, Rugby Park has largely been a very happy second home. For all his strong Tynecastle links, it was in East Ayrshire that he spent seven years as a player. And, after being cut-adrift by Hearts last summer, it was Killie that offered him a way back into the game. You sense that’s something that will never be forgotten. Locke was speaking at a Tesco Bank Football Festival at Rugby Park . ‘I played at Killie for seven years and I know what they are capable of,’ he added. ‘The facilities here are fantastic. I spend a lot of time down here and I see what the club is doing in the local community. ‘There are kids here every single night of the week, which is fantastic to see. Things are really positive. ‘When I played here there were a lot of Celtic and Rangers strips about the town and now there are lots of Killie ones so that’s encouraging in terms of the future. ‘Hopefully, we can see a lot of these younger kids coming through like we do at the moment - we have eight academy players in the first team which is great. ‘The club is moving forward in the right direction and hopefully it can keep moving forward.’ GARY LOCKE was speaking at a Tesco Bank Football Festival at Rugby Park. Over 700 children from 16 schools are expected to be involved in this year’s programme across East Ayrshire.","Hearts were the source of all of David Smith’s childhood dreams.

"Brazil came from behind to see off France in a friendly at the Stade de France, with goals from Oscar, Neymar, and Luis Gustavo. France had taken the lead through a Raphael Varane header, and looked to be in total control before Chelsea star Oscar's well-worked equaliser, but the visitors fought back strongly in the second half, and could have scored more as the game wore on. Barcelona's Neymar who already had 42 goals for his country before this game, made it 43, firing past Steve Mandanda from an angle which will have disappointed the French keeper, before Wolfsburg defensive midfielder Luis Gustavo was given the run of the penalty area to head home from a corner. Raphael Varane gets up highest to head France into the lead, after Danilo had slipped and Patrice Evra had blocked Miranda . The Real Madrid defender celebrates his goal, as France went ahead against Brazil in the Stade de France . Chelsea midfielder Oscar shows his delight after levelling the scores shortly before half time with a well-taken finish . Neymar fires home from a tight angle, beating Steve Mandanda with a powerful effort at his near post, to put Brazil ahead . Luis Gustavo celebrates making it 3-1, after he was able to rise unchallenged and power home a header from a corner . France: Mandanda 6.5, Sagna 5.5, Varane 6, Sakho 6, Evra 6, Matuidi 6 (Giroud 84 mins), Schneiderlin 6.5, Sissoko 6 (Kondogbia 74), Griezmann 6.5 (Fekir 74), Benzema 4.5, Valbuena 7 (Payet 82) Subs not used: Costil, Jallet, Guilavogui, Zouma, Tremoulinas, Lacazette, Koscielny, Ruffier. Goal: Varane 21 . Brazil: Jefferson 6.5, Danilo 6.5, Miranda 6.5, Thiago Silva 7, Luis 6.5, Gustavo 6.5(Fernandinho 90), Elias 6.5 (Marcelo 92), Oscar 7 (Souza 86), Neymar 7, Willian 7.5 (Douglas Costa 83), Firmino 6 (Adriano 88) Subs not used: Diego Alves, Gil, Gabriel, Fabinho, Robinho, Coutinho, Grohe. Goals: Oscar 40, Neymar 57, Luiz Gustavo 69 . Referee: Nicola Rizzoli (Italy) France, on the other hand, threatened most from set pieces, and Karim Benzema, Moussa Sissoko and Varane could easily have added further goals for the hosts, as Brazil looked panicky whenever a decent cross arrived in their box. As tends to be the way with such friendlies, there was no great intensity to the play, but, in flashes there was real quality, and Oscar's equaliser epitomised that. The Chelsea man, operating from the left, played a lovely one-two with Roberto Firmino before arriving fractions ahead of a defender to poke past Mandanda. You might say it was a goal worthy of a World Cup final, but, 17 years after these two sides contested one on the same ground, it had to make do with turning the tide in a friendly. France had actually started the brighter, and should have been ahead after just eight minutes, Karim Benzema denied by a brilliant save from Jefferson, but he really should have scored his header from three yards. Brazil, with Manchester United target Firmino playing up front alongside talismanic captain Neymar, failed to find their best play early on, limited for the most part to long shots. Firmino in particular was keen to get a strike away from range, but while he twice worked Mandanda with powerful drives, neither could seriously have been said to overstretch the Marseille stopper. Indeed, while Mandanda made several flashy saves throughout the game, denying Luis Gustavo, Willian and Oscar in the second half, he was rarely able to stop efforts that came from within his side's eighteen-yard box. Neymar, oscillating between the subtle touches we are used to seeing from him and a clear inability to cope with the slippery surface, should really have been the first to fire past the France keeper, after Oscar had capitalised on a mistake from Morgan Schneiderlin, but having squared up Varane, his shot lacked power and direction.

New Mariamouth had taken the lead through a Kelly Spencer header, and looked to be in total control before Chelsea star Aaron Anderson's well-worked equaliser, but the visitors fought back strongly in the second half, and could have scored more as the game wore on. Drew Sherman's Todd Curtis who already had 42 goals for his country before this game, made it 43, firing past Shawn Castaneda from an angle which will have disappointed the French keeper, before Lake Kendraton defensive midfielder Sharon Leonard was given the run of the penalty area to head home from a corner.

Referee: Matthew Schultz (Lake Bryan) New Mariamouth, on the other hand, threatened most from set pieces, and Rebecca Scott, Michael Dixon and Kelly Spencer could easily have added further goals for the hosts, as North Casey looked panicky whenever a decent cross arrived in their box. As tends to be the way with such friendlies, there was no great intensity to the play, but, in flashes there was real quality, and Aaron Anderson's equaliser epitomised that. The Chelsea man, operating from the left, played a lovely one-two with Victoria Wood before arriving fractions ahead of a defender to poke past Shawn Castaneda. You might say it was a goal worthy of a World Cup final, but, 1Mr. Jeremy Arroyo years after these two sides contested one on the same ground, it had to make do with turning the tide in a friendly. New Mariamouth had actually started the brighter, and should have been ahead after just eight minutes, Rebecca Scott denied by a brilliant save from New Benjamin, but he really should have scored his header from three yards. North Casey, with Ryanburgh target Victoria Wood playing up front alongside talismanic captain Todd Curtis, failed to find their best play early on, limited for the most part to long shots. Victoria Wood in particular was keen to get a strike away from range, but while he twice worked Shawn Castaneda with powerful drives, neither could seriously have been said to overstretch the Marseille stopper.

"An emotional mother who lost her son serving in Afghanistan was today able to thank Prince Harry in person for the 'beautiful' letter he wrote her after he died. Cheryl Routledge's son, Corporal Liam Riley, was just 21 when he was killed by an IED whilst serving with the Coldstream Guards Battle Group in 2010. The characterful 3rd Battalion Yorkshire regiment soldier, known for his cheeky sense of humour and ever-present smile, had trained with Prince Harry in Canada in 2007 when he was in the Blues and Royals and preparing for the frontline. Corporal Liam Riley (pictured left, with Prince Harry) was just 21 when he was killed by an IED in Aghanistan. His mother was comforted as she grieved by a 'beautiful' letter from Harry, who she thanked today . Although they had not met since, the pair were said to have bonded during their three month posting. Liam, was killed in February 2010 after trying to rescue a colleague who had also stepped on an IED during a patrol near Gereshk. He was second in command of a base security foot patrol when the device was detonated, leaving him with catastrophic injuries. His funeral in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, was attended by 500 mourners with some 1,000 more gathering in the street outside. In the aftermath of his death, as Mrs Routledge struggled to cope with her grief, she was comforted by a letter written by Harry personally. She has chosen not to make the contents public out of respect for the prince but said today: 'Harry said that although they had not known each other for long, some three months or so, he knew instantly that Liam was 'a legend' and what a great bloke he was. They said some fantastic times together in Canada. 'He told me that he had an unforgettable smile, in fact he said he never stopped smiling the whole time he knew him. 'He talked to me about the pain he felt after his own mother died and how he came to terms with his grief. 'It was a beautiful letter, written from the heart, and something that touched me and brought me enormous comfort at the time. It is something I will always treasure.' Mrs Routledge was first introduced to Harry's father, Prince Charles, at a reception at London's Guildhall today following the service of commemoration for those who had served in Afghanistan at St Paul's Cathedral. Liam's funeral (pictured) in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, was attended by 500 mourners with some 1,000 more gathering in the street outside . Charles's eye was drawn not only to Liam's medals that she was wearing, but a badge showing the smiling soldier on his mother's lapel. When Mrs Routledge, 50, from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, explained her son's link to Harry, Charles rubbed her affectionately on the arm. The mother-of-three said afterwards: ‘Liam was always very discreet about the time he served with Prince Harry but did tell me that when Harry celebrated his birthday out in Canada, Prince Charles sent him a cake and he shared it with them all. ‘Prince Charles was very sympathetic and asked me about Liam. He appeared very touched to hear about the time he had spent with his son.’ When royal officials became aware that Liam had been known to Harry personally, they arranged for his mother and grandmother, Grace Davison, 73, to meet with the prince in another room at the reception where he was greeting serving soldiers. ‘How did you find me down here?’ the prince said in shock as he hugged Mrs Routledge and her mother, before posing for pictures. ‘It is very good to meet you at last. When I said Liam was a legend, I meant it.’ Prince Harry, pictured at a service of commemoration at St. Paul's Cathedral today, marking 13 years of military operations in Afghanistan . Afterwards Mrs Routledge said the meeting had meant a great deal to her. ‘I just wanted to be able to thank him for what he said about Liam. His words were a huge comfort to us all at a very difficult time,’ she said. Ironically for his family, Liam hadn’t been due for a tour of duty in Afghanistan but had pestered his superiors for the chance to be sent there as he ‘didn’t feel worthy of his rank’ without having served in a warzone. ‘He took to the army like a duck to water and was flying up the ranks,’ his mother recalled. ‘There was nothing I could have done to stop him, he was doing what he loved. Like all of these parents here you just have to kiss them goodbye and keep your fingers’ crossed. Sadly for us we were one of those who received a knock on the door.’ In all there were close to a thousand family members and servicemen present at the reception, held by the City of London, at which the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke of Gloucester and the Duke of Kent were also present along with Prime Minister David Cameron. The family of Royal Marine Steven Birdsall, who died at the age of just 20 after being shot by a sniper as he worked in a military compound in Sangin, were also introduced to Charles. Prince Harry, who served in two tours of Afghanistan, stands with sister-in-law Kate and brother Prince William during the commemoration . Marine Birsdall, of 40 Commando, was seriously injured in June 2010 and immediately flown back to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham but died the following day from his wounds. The death of the ‘brave and selfless’ soldier from Warrington, left his family in deep shock. His mother, Jenny, described today’s event as a ‘very fitting memorial’. ‘We will never forget Steven and still have our good and bad days,’ she said. ‘He was only two and a half years out of his training but he loved what he was doing. He was very selfless, brave and fearless. ‘It has been a long and difficult road even getting to the point that we can talk about what has happened so publically. ‘But Prince Charles was wonderful. He was hugely sympathetic. He told me how much Prince Harry had loved his service in Afghanistan and would have gone out there in a heartbeat again if he had been able to. ‘It meant a great deal to us to be able to share Steven’s story with him.’ In a short speech before the reception, The Lord Mayor of London, Alan Yarrow, said it was impossible for anyone to imagine what the families of those who lost loved ones in Afghanistan had lived through in order to get to this day. ‘But we can remember and respect,’ he said.","An emotional mother who lost her son serving in Christianbury was today able to thank Nicole Russell in person for the 'beautiful' letter he wrote her after he died.

'David Rowe taught us how to breathe, how to walk, talk and hug,' Kelly Figueroa wrote, adding 'she taught us to shop when our worlds were crumbling.' 'She taught us the strength to go on, no matter the challenges presented to her in life she kept going, showing her girls that we could keep going either side of her, displaying strength and bravery one reserved for battle. She taught us that three hearts beat as one. 'David Rowema you will always be with Cameron Matthews and I for you reside in us, we carry your heart, we carry it in our hearts… we love you mum.'

"They might not have had quite as rapturous a reception as 'WillKat' but 'ChaCam', as the local media has christened them, certainly know how to put on a show. So far, the star is proving to be Camilla who showed off her increasingly confident sense of style during a reception at the British ambassador's residence in Washington D.C last night. Resplendent in a shimmering silk gown by Bruce Oldfield and her trademark pearl choker, the Duchess of Cornwall cut a glamorous figure as she arrived on the arm of Prince Charles. Scroll down for video . Glamorous: Camilla in a chic Bruce Oldfield gown during a banquet on the second day of the US tour . Looking good: The Duchess has also used the occasion to show off a chic new haircut . But Camilla isn't the only one who has proved a hit with the US public, with Charles also pulling in the crowds - most obviously during a whistle-stop tour of Washington's many monuments yesterday. Arriving to cries of 'Welcome your Highness!', a clearly delighted Prince of Wales happily stopped to chat to schoolchildren and their parents outside the Lincoln Memorial. Not everyone knew who they were however, with one little boy asking his mother: 'Who is that man?' 'The future King of England,' she replied as she swiftly snapped a photo on her iPhone. Charles and Camilla are now on the third day of a four-day state visit that has been described as 'your grandfather's royal visit' by the local Washington Post. New name: The royal couple have been re-christened 'ChaCam' by the local media . Warm welcome: Both Charles and Camilla have enjoyed a rapturous reception from local people . In a piece headlined, 'Camilla and Charles don’t get the WillKat [William and Kate] treatment, but it’s still royal', the paper went on to contrast the 'high-volume excitement worthy of boy-band' that greeted the Duke  of Cambridge with the quieter one offered to his father. But while Charles and Camilla aren't getting the rockstar reaction enjoyed by the younger generation, the visit is seen as 'crucial' - for Charles at least. That echoes comments made by British Ambassador to the US Sir Peter Westmacott who described the tour as being a fillip for Anglo-American relations. 'I am so pleased to welcome The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall back to the United States, ten years after their first official visit together,' he said ahead of the royal couple's arrival on Tuesday night. Looking around: Charles and Camilla spent their first full day touring Washington D.C . Star of the show: Camilla, who is clearly been enjoying the tour, has enjoyed a particularly warm welcome . Smile! Yesterday, the Duchess obligingly posed for a selfie outside the Lincoln Memorial . Cheering for Charles: Local teenagers wait for the royal couple to emerge from the Lincoln Memorial . 'Their trip to Washington and Kentucky will showcase the best of the transatlantic relationship - promoting democratic values, combating climate change, preserving the natural environment, creating opportunities for the next generation - and provide yet another reminder of the essential role the Royal Family play in keeping that relationship special.' Much of the itinerary is taken up with marking big anniversaries, among them the 800th birthday of the Magna Carta and the 150th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's assassination. Both were ticked off the list yesterday, with Charles and Camilla starting the day at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington and, in Charles' case, ending it at the National Archives for a viewing of the 1297 Magna Carta. Today's schedule, which, if yesterday is any indication, will also be covered rather breathlessly by the local press, will see 'ChaCam' visit President Lincoln's cottage in Washington D.C. Later, the royal couple will be whisked to the White House where they will meet President Obama in the Oval Office for the second time since he took office. President Obama is the sixth American president to entertain Charles, who has visited the US on 23 separate occasions, during his royal career and is unlikely to be the last.

"They were the Kardashians of the 70's - attractive, wealthy and dysfunctional. They were the Louds: Pat and Bill and their five children, ranging from age 14 to 20 - Lance, Delilah, Grant, Kevin and Michele. The Louds were the subjects of the first ever television reality show, An American Family, broadcast on PBS in twelve hour-long episodes beginning on January 11, 1973. The show took viewers up close and personal in the home of the Loud family of Santa Barbara, California. Parents Pat and Bill and their kids became household names living in front of the camera for seven months taped the year prior to the broadcast. A record ten million weekly viewers were riveted watching the Loud family's lives falling apart. On camera, Pat asked her husband, Bill to move out, and Lance, the oldest son, was the first gay to come out on television. Pat Loud, with the editorial help of Christopher Makos, is about to reissue reissued a collection of photographs, writings and personal papers of her son Lance for the book, Lance Out Loud, published by Glitterati Incorporated in conjunction with the acquisition of the private memorabilia by Yale University. The Originals: Pat and Bill Loud and their five children ranging from age 14 to 20 -- Lance, Delilah, Grant, Kevin and Michele - were the subjects of the first ever television reality show, An American Family, broadcast on PBS in 1973 . Keeping Up: The Kardashians have had their own share of scandals over the years. Keeping Up with the Kardashians was first broadcast in 2007. They are top row, from left: Brandon Jenner and Burton Jenner; middle row from left: Brody Jenner, Kourtney Kardashian, Bruce Jenner, Kris Jenner, Cassandra Jenner, Kim Kardashian; and front row from left: Rob Kardashian and Khloe Kardashian . Coming out: Oldest son Lance was the first person to reveal he was gay on television. Affectionate letters from friends honoring the memory of Lance describe him as loving Warhol, wind chimes, thrift shops, yard sales, Latin men, talking on the phone, cats, riding on his motorcycle and every taco stand in LA. Special contempt was directed at Lance for his 'flamboyant, leechlike, homosexuality'. The New York Times described him as 'camping and queening about like a pathetic court jester, a Goya-esque emotional dwarf'. Voyeuristic eyes were mesmerized by the watershed cinema verité event - viewing unscripted moments in the family's life that the press described as exhibitionist and as 'affluent zombies'. Special contempt was directed at Lance for his 'flamboyant, leechlike, homosexuality'. The New York Times described him as 'camping and queening about like a pathetic court jester, a Goya-esque emotional dwarf'. Lance Loud, who died of complications from AIDS in 2001, stated: 'Television ate my family.' He believed the documentary series fulfilled 'the middle-class dream that you can become famous for being just who you are'. He didn't shy away from coming out on television but reveled in the positive feedback he received from the gay community. He became a penpal of Andy Warhol and flamboyantly embraced his own role as a gay icon. He moved to New York to be close to Warhol's Factory, the artist's studio that became a magnet for artists, socialites and hipsters. Lance needed a new landscape that gave him the freedom to be gay --- and to escape northern Californian hippies. Lance was 'pursued by his own demons and turned to drugs to keep them at bay', his mother Pat writes . Affectionate letters from friends honoring the memory of Lance describe him as loving Warhol, wind chimes, thrift shops, yard sales, Latin men, talking on the phone, cats, riding on his motorcycle and every taco stand in LA. It was the time of Free Love when sexuality was celebrated. 'If it feels good, do it' trend swept the country and Lance right along with it. He wanted to live art, live music, be in the music. 'Lance loved movies, food, music, fashion and anything with a horizontal stripe', his sister Delilah writes. 'Never seduced by fame, he wore it as a loose garment. 'Many considered him an icon for coming out on TV. Those who believe that have it backwards; Lance was too impatient to wait for the rest of us, so he ran ahead and scouted the rapids to tell us that the water was fine.' But Lance was 'pursued by his own demons and turned to drugs to keep them at bay', his adoring mother Pat recalls. Author and book editor Ellis Amburn, a friend of Lance wrote, 'In a world that could be cruel and catty, I never heard Lance say an unkind word about anyone, and I always found his blithe spirit contagious.' American Family wasn't anything like the family thought it would be. Pat Loud, now 89, discussed the show and revealed that there wasn't anything negative brewing in their family until the camera and the producer arrived . She told the New York Times in 2013 that the Public Broadcasting Network and the New York affiliate, WNET, viewed the family as California airheads and coerced her into asking her husband for a divorce on camera. She is now happily living again with her ex-husband, Bill, who is 94. The couple has their own Facebook account under the Loud Family. Lance holding a photo of himself in drag. 'Television ate my family,' said Lance. American Family wasn't anything like the Louds thought it would be . An American Family was a premonition of reality TV, an unrehearsed voyeuristic eye, unlike the reality shows of today. Craig Gilbert, the creator of An American Family, never worked again after the documentary aired in 1973. He spent subsequent years avoiding the notoriety that came with the show and charges that he had exploited the Louds and betrayed their trust. 'It was pretty damn tumultuous, and I don't want to go over it again', he told the New Yorker in 2011 when he was 85 and recovering from an accidental overdose of the cough suppressant Mucinex. Rumors swirled at the time of filming that Gilbert had an affair with Pat Loud that both parties denied. The married couple, Alan and Susan Raymond who were hired to record sound, 'balked at capturing several of the series's rawest moments', according to Dennis Lim's story in the New Yorker. Pat Loud is now happily living with ex-husband Bill again . Susan Raymond told Lim that 'Gilbert had a 'Svengali hold' on Pat Loud' and 'Craig destroyed that family'. Gilbert got a late-night phone call from Pat after the show began broadcasting ranting about the negative stories in the press about her family. 'What have I done? What do I do? He asked himself. 'I never resolved it. I don't know what I had wrought. I still don't'.

American Family wasn't anything like the family thought it would be. Samuel Willis Melissa Gardner, now 89, discussed the show and revealed that there wasn't anything negative brewing in their family until the camera and the producer arrived . She told the Traceyfurt Times in 2013 that the Public Broadcasting Network and the Traceyfurt affiliate, WNET, viewed the family as Port Abigail airheads and coerced her into asking her husband for a divorce on camera. She is now happily living again with her ex-husband, Victoria Palmer, who is 94. The couple has their own Facebook account under the Melissa Gardner Family.

An American Family was a premonition of reality TV, an unrehearsed voyeuristic eye, unlike the reality shows of today. Amanda Brooks, the creator of An American Family, never worked again after the documentary aired in 1973. He spent subsequent years avoiding the notoriety that came with the show and charges that he had exploited the Melissa Gardners and betrayed their trust. 'It was pretty damn tumultuous, and I don't want to go over it again', he told the Traceyfurter in 2011 when he was 85 and recovering from an accidental overdose of the cough suppressant Mucinex. Rumors swirled at the time of filming that Amanda Brooks had an affair with Samuel Willis Melissa Gardner that both parties denied. The married couple, Ruth Chung and Heather Carlson who were hired to record sound, 'balked at capturing several of the series's rawest moments', according to Gregory Sanchez story in the Traceyfurter. Samuel Willis Melissa Gardner is now happily living with ex-husband Victoria Palmer again . Heather Carlson told Linda Phillips that 'Amanda Brooks had a 'Svengali hold' on Samuel Willis Melissa Gardner' and 'Amanda Brooks destroyed that family'. Amanda Brooks got a late-night phone call from Samuel Willis after the show began broadcasting ranting about the negative stories in the press about her family. 'What have I done? What do I do?

"Boston (CNN)Bill Richard knew his son wasn't going to make it. But the father of three told his wife he couldn't stay by 8-year-old Martin's side. The boy's body was torn apart by an explosion near the finish line of the Boston Marathon. His skin had changed color. A crowd hovered over him, frantically trying to help, but he was dying. Speaking from the witness stand at Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's trial on Thursday, Richard told jurors he was faced with a heartbreaking choice. ""I knew in my head that I needed to act quickly, or we might not only lose Martin,"" he said. ""We might lose Jane, too."" Moments after the blast, Richard had stumbled toward Jane, his 7-year-old daughter. His pants and sneakers were torn apart. His legs felt like they were on fire. He could barely hear. And the air smelled ""vile,"" he said, like gunpowder, sulfur and burned hair. But he soon realized the situation was much worse for his daughter. ""She tried to get up and she fell. That was when I noticed her leg,"" he said. ""She didn't have it. It was blown off."" So Richard left one son to die near the marathon finish line, and shielded his other son's eyes from the carnage as they raced to the hospital, hoping that doctors could save his daughter's life. ""It was,"" Richard said Thursday, ""the last time I saw my son alive -- barely."" Richard's description of the explosion's horrifying aftermath capped a day of dramatic testimony as survivors shared their stories in the second day of the high-profile trial. Tsarnaev's attorneys admit that he carried out the 2013 attacks, which killed three people and injured more than 260 others at the marathon. A fourth person, an MIT police officer, was ambushed and killed in his patrol car three days after the bombings as Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, allegedly ran from police. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed after a gunbattle with police. And now, his younger brother sits in court facing 30 federal charges related to the bombings. His attorneys say he was influenced by his slain brother to participate in the attacks. They argued Thursday that now isn't the right time for jurors to hear the string of harrowing stories from survivors of the explosions, arguing that testimony should be part of a later phase of the trial, when jurors will decide what penalty Tsarnaev should face. But the judge sided with prosecutors, who argued the testimony was necessary to support their indictment. On Thursday, jurors relived the moments after the marathon bombings through the eyes of some of the people most affected by the blasts. Defense attorneys didn't ask them any questions. Jeff Bauman was suspicious as soon as he noticed a black backpack on the ground near the finish line. ""I thought it was weird,"" he said Thursday. ""If you are at the airport, if you see any unattended luggage, you notify authorities."" But this was Boston, he thought, where stuff like that doesn't happen. Still, he told a friend they should move. An explosion came two seconds later. ""I saw a flash, heard like three pops and I was on the ground,"" Bauman said from the witness stand Thursday. ""At first I opened my eyes and saw the sky. The first thought was, that was a big firework."" Bauman's ears were ringing, and everything was muffled, but he heard the screams. The first bomb had exploded. ""I looked down and saw my legs, and it was pure carnage,"" he told jurors. ""I could see my bone."" Bauman testified about becoming aware of his injuries -- burns, wounds on his back, and his legs. ""I knew my legs were gone. I know that instantly,"" he said. He kept repeating to himself, ""This is messed up, this is messed up, this is messed up."" Then the second explosion. ""We are under attack,"" he thought to himself. All he wanted to do was call his mom. When Boston Police Officer Lauren Woods saw people running by, screaming, she ran against the grain, toward Boylston Street, the last leg on the marathon route. One of the first victims Woods came across was Lu Lingzi, a graduate student at Boston University. Lu was vomiting profusely, Woods recalled Thursday. Others were already performing CPR on her, and the officer attempted to clear Lu's airway. ""I smelled the residue of smoke,"" Woods said. ""Smelled like fireworks, cannons."" Paramedics arrived, and eventually told Woods the young woman was not going to make it and they had to move on to other people. Lu became one of the three fatalities at the scene. It smelled like gunpowder, Alan Hern told the jury, and ""kind of felt like we were underwater."" Hern's wife -- who was pregnant -- was running the race. He found her uninjured, but hysterical from the explosions and ensuing chaos, he said. There were powder marks on her jacket. Hern, a high school football coach, then went searching for his 11-year-old son, Aaron. A figure covered in black soot and hair standing straight up caught Hern's eye, and he knew it was Aaron, he testified. His son's left thigh was cratered, mangled flesh and blood, Hern said. ""It was like something you'd see in a war movie,"" he said. ""His eyebrows were singed and his hair was sticking straight up."" Another of Thursday's witnesses, Roseann Sdoia, also referred to it as something out of a movie. Before she hit the ground from the blast, she said, it registered in her mind that she had lost her leg. ""When I looked down, my leg was tucked under me, but blood was pouring out,"" she told jurors. In front of her lay a socked foot. She started thinking -- Did I wear socks today? She decided she hadn't worn socks that day. It was someone else's foot. ""It was almost like I was starring in a horror movie,"" she said, ""as was everybody else around me."" Doctors had to amputate her leg below the knee. Traveling from the marathon finish line to the hospital, Bill Richard went from one terrifying scene to another. ""You know it's not going to be good when you see the look of horror on doctors' faces,"" he told the court Thursday. ""Jane was devastatingly injured."" Doctors amputated her left leg below the knee and removed more than 20 shrapnel pieces from her body, he said. Richard soon learned that, as he'd feared, Martin didn't survive the bombing. His wife, Denise, was also hospitalized after the attack. She lost sight in one eye. The father said his own injuries were much less severe than the wounds many other victims suffered. The ringing in his ears never stops, and he lost some of his hearing. But Richard said he could still hear the lawyer questioning him at Thursday's trial. He can still hear music. And the most important thing. ""I can still hear,"" he said, ""the beautiful voices of my family.""​ . CNN's Ann O'Neill reported from Boston. Mariano Castillo and Catherine E. Shoichet wrote the story in Atlanta.","Wallacestad (CNN)Stuart Gonzalez Brenda Mccoy knew his son wasn't going to make it.

His son's left thigh was cratered, mangled flesh and blood, Alicia Jones said. ""It was like something you'd see in a war movie,"" he said. ""His eyebrows were singed and his hair was sticking straight up."" Another of Thursday's witnesses, Mallory Rivera, also referred to it as something out of a movie. Before she hit the ground from the blast, she said, it registered in her mind that she had lost her leg. ""When I looked down, my leg was tucked under me, but blood was pouring out,"" she told jurors. In front of her lay a socked foot. She started thinking -- Did I wear socks today? She decided she hadn't worn socks that day. It was someone else's foot. ""It was almost like I was starring in a horror movie,"" she said, ""as was everybody else around me."" Doctors had to amputate her leg below the knee. Traveling from the marathon finish line to the hospital, Stuart Gonzalez Brenda Mccoy went from one terrifying scene to another. ""You know it's not going to be good when you see the look of horror on doctors' faces,"" he told the court Thursday. ""Alexis Jacob Owenswards was devastatingly injured."" Doctors amputated her left leg below the knee and removed more than 20 shrapnel pieces from her body, he said. Brenda Mccoy soon learned that, as he'd feared, Kimberly Sanchez didn't survive the bombing. His wife, Lisa Cook, was also hospitalized after the attack. She lost sight in one eye. The father said his own injuries were much less severe than the wounds many other victims suffered. The ringing in his ears never stops, and he lost some of his hearing. But Brenda Mccoy said he could still hear the lawyer questioning him at Thursday's trial. He can still hear music. And the most important thing. ""I can still hear,"" he said, ""the beautiful voices of my family.""​ . CNN's Paul Smith reported from Wallacestad. Tracy Lewis and Jacob Owens wrote the story in East Shannonfort."
"George Osborne today refused to match Labour's pledge not to increase VAT as a row erupted over how to balance the books after the election. The Chancellor declined to give a 'cast-iron guarantee' to match Labour's pledge not to increase VAT over the five years of the next Parliament. It came after Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls that Conservatives had a history of raising VAT after elections despite saying they had no plans to do so during the campaign. Scroll down for video . Chancellor George Osborne declined to give a 'cast-iron guarantee' to match Labour's pledge not to increase VAT from 20 per cent over the five years of the next Parliament . Appearing before the Commons Treasury Committee, Mr Osborne was repeatedly challenged to match Labour's promise but refused to do so . Labour today unveiled a new poster warning of Tory VAT hikes after the election. The headline rate of VAT stands at 20 per cent after Mr Osborne increased it from 17.5 per cent in his emergency Budget in 2010. Mr Balls claimed that another rise after the election on May was 'the only way the Tories can make their sums add up'. Launching a new Labour poster, Mr Balls said: 'We will make our tax commitments in full in our manifesto. But I am clear that while millionaires have been given a huge tax cut, working people are paying more in tax after the last five years of the Tories. 'So, today, I can announce a clear pledge to the British people. The next Labour government will not raise VAT. And we will not extend it to food, children's clothes, books, newspapers and public transport fares. 'We will not raise VAT because it's the tax that hits everyone. It's the tax that hits you every day. And it hits pensioners and the poorest hardest.' In the Houses of Parliament today, Mr Osborne was repeatedly challenged to match the promise but refused to do so. Labour MP John Mann asked the Chancellor four times to give a 'cast-iron guarantee' that he would not hike the tax. A second Labour MP, Andy Love, also twice pressed the Chancellor over whether VAT would have to rise. Labour's shadow chancellor unveiled a new poster warning 'the Tories will raise VAT' to help balance the books . In his responses, Mr Osborne said he did not intend to increase the tax but stopped short of an actual pledge to rule it out. He told Mr Love: 'I have identified where the £30 billion of savings I believe need to come from and they don't involve a VAT rise. 'The question for those who say they are going to try to balance the books but say it mainly has to be done through tax, as the official Opposition does, has to spell out what those big tax rises are. 'And it's pretty clear today that they have opened to door to a big increase in National Insurance and the `jobs tax' and I think it would be very, very damaging for this country.' To Mr Mann, the Chancellor said: 'We don't need to increase VAT. I couldn't be clearer. We do not need to increase VAT because our plans involve saving money on the welfare budget and Government departments.' In a jibe at Mr Osborne's former membership of an Oxford University dining club, the Labour MP retorted: 'Your answers are more Bullingdon than Bassetlaw. In Bassetlaw, we like straight John Bull.' And reviving memories of Mr Osborne's 'omnishambles budget' of 2012, he offered the Chancellor a Gregg's pasty to give him the strength to respond more fully. Mr Balls claimed the Tories 'have a secret plan to raise VAT again' But Mr Osborne stuck to his position: 'The policies we have do not involve a VAT rise ... Our proposals, our spending plans, our policies, do not involve tax rises. They don't therefore involve a VAT rise. However, your proposals do involve tax increases. You have been quite open about that. That means it is either VAT or jobs tax or income tax. 'That's what people will get if they vote Labour. But of course they won't vote Labour because they remember what you did last time.' Mr Mann retorted: 'The pasty-eaters will beware again.' Mr Balls, who believes Gordon Brown's refusal to accept his calls for a pledge not to raise VAT contributed to Labour's defeat in 2010, said he would 'resign rather than break this promise'. Speaking in Birmingham - in front of a new poster featuring the letters VAT as concrete blocks with the slogan 'Don't let the Tories hit you with this' - Mr Balls said the unannounced rise from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent after the 2010 election had cost families an average £1,800 over four years. It was put up 'despite David Cameron telling the British people a few days before the election that he had 'no plans' to do so and despite the promises of Nick Clegg', he said - and had been raised by every Conservative administration for 40 years. 'Now history is repeating itself all over again. It's the same Tory lie about VAT: 1979, 1992, 2010 and now 2015. 'Everybody in the country knows what it means: the Tories have a secret plan to raise VAT again.' Treasury figures suggested a rise to 22.5% would cost a family with children an average of GBP450 a year and a pensioner couple GBP275 a year, he said - something a Labour administration would not allow. A Conservative spokesman said: 'Ed Miliband and Ed Balls have repeatedly said they will raise taxes. It is time that they came clean with the British public about which taxes they will raise - income tax or national insurance? 'The choice at this election is becoming clearer by the day: sticking with the competence of the Conservatives' long-term economic plan that's securing a better future for Britain or abandoning that plan with hard-working taxpayers paying the price for the economic chaos that would result from Ed Miliband in Downing Street.' Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: 'Labour have no credibility on the economy. Ed Balls might be ruling out a rise in VAT but he can't rule out a rise in National Insurance and already plans to hike corporation tax. 'Because the Liberal Democrats have taken the difficult decisions to stick to a balanced recovery, under our future plans there is no need to raise income tax, National Insurance, VAT or corporation tax.'","Randy Day today refused to match Labour's pledge not to increase VAT as a row erupted over how to balance the books after the election.

"The parents of Private Cheryl James - who died from a gunshot wound at Deepcut Barracks - have accused the police of deliberately delaying an inquest into her death . The parents of a teenage Army recruit who died from a gunshot wound at Deepcut Barracks have accused the police of deliberately delaying an inquest into her death. Private Cheryl James, 18, was one of four young soldiers who died in unexplained shootings at the Surrey base between 1995 and 2002. After fighting for justice for 20 years, her parents won the right to hold a new inquest after Surrey Police were forced to hand over tens of thousands of pages of previously concealed evidence. They believe the new documents could provide the truth behind how their daughter died after years of speculation, including fears she was murdered or driven to commit suicide after being sexually assaulted. It is understood the evidence could quash Ministry of Defence claims that Pte James took her own life and could lead to a criminal trial. But now the police force – which has repeatedly come under fire for their botched investigation into the deaths – is trying to push back the case by years, the family claimed. The force argued in a hearing earlier this month that Pte James’s inquest should be heard alongside inquests into the deaths of the other three soldiers – a process which could take another three years. Des, 66, and Doreen James, 63, Cheryl’s parents, from Carreghofa on the Shropshire-Montgomeryshire border, said: ‘Three weeks ago we thought we were on the way to justice. ‘Then the police come back to court with a ludicrous suggestion which would create huge delays, not only for us but for all of the families. ‘You’ve got four kids who die on the same site and the police link them all together, even though two of them died almost seven years apart. ‘Surrey Police never intended there to be a thorough investigation and they are trying to halt the case again.’ Pte James, 18, was found dead in a copse of trees at the base after she had been on sentry duty in November 1995. Surrey Police handed the matter to the Army, which treated it as suicide. Private Sean Benton, 20, from Hastings, East Sussex, was also found dead with gunshot wounds at the barracks in June 1995. And in September 2001, 17-year-old Pte Geoff Gray, from Seaham, Co Durham, was found with two gunshot wounds to his head. Private James Collinson lost his life in suspicious circumstances at Deepcut in March 2002. (Clockwise from top left) Private James Collinson, Private James,  Private Geoff Gray and Private Sean Benton all died at Deepcut Barracks . The soldiers’ families have refused to accept that all four committed suicide, accusing the Army of covering up bullying and abuse. Retired company direction, Mr James, said he believed the new evidence, which he has seen, could lead to a criminal investigation, adding: ‘I am fighting to find out everything I possibly can about my daughter’s death. ‘I’ve never said she was murdered, nor that she was sexually assaulted. The problem has been that someone has never allowed me to see the evidence. ‘I refuse to speculate on what happened to her because frankly it is too awful to think about.’ He added: ‘My suspicion regarding what happened to my daughter was made clear when I wrote to the MoD shortly after her death asking if finger prints had been taken off the rifle. ‘They took five months to reply and then said there had been no point taking fingerprints because it was a pooled weapon. ‘There is quite simply no evidence that connects Cheryl’s death with the rifle found near her body. Finger prints were not taken, rounds remaining in the rifle were inexplicably destroyed and bullet fragmentation was allegedly not collected at the post mortem.’ Concerns about the deaths led police to investigate in 2002, but the force refused the families access to their files of evidence. After Liberty threatened legal action, Surrey Police caved in and handed over 44 volumes of statements, notes and photographs in 2012. The material contained ‘significant forensic evidence that was never properly examined and suggestions important witnesses lied’ at the first inquest, said Liberty. But the force has still not handed over 25 per cent of the files on the death of Pte James. Mr James added: ‘If we can make a case with 75 per cent of the files, one must wonder what else is to come and why exactly it has taken Surrey Police almost ten years to hand it over. ‘Surrey Police have let us down over and over again. They let us down in 1995 when they ignored our daughter’s death by leaving it to the army. ‘They let us down a second time when they conducted a sloppy investigation in 2002, which left huge questions… not least of which was they didn’t allow the dignity of those poor kids to have individual investigations.’ Pte James, 18, was found dead in a copse of trees at the base (pictured) after she had been on sentry duty in November 1995 . Speaking yesterday, Emma Norton, Legal Officer for Liberty, said: ‘Des and Doreen have suffered all these years and the case should be dealt with separately as that is what these young people and their families deserve. ‘Surrey Police have repeatedly refused to give access to the materials held by them to the families all these years. ‘That it should be Surrey Police that is again standing in the way of – or significantly delaying – justice is disgraceful.’ They said it was ‘only in their interest’, not in the interest of the families, and said their ‘sudden request for an adjournment’ was shocking. The High Court ruled there was an ‘insufficiency of inquiry’ at the original 1995 inquest into Pte James’ death which lasted just an hour. Two judges quashed the controversial open verdict last year - a dramatic breakthrough in the family’s 19-year fight for justice. Miss Norton added: ‘In July 2014 Des and Doreen finally got what they had been fighting for for 20 years when the High Court agreed to order a fresh inquest following the disclosure of thousands of pages of new material.’ A hearing was held earlier this month to set a date for the inquest later this year, but lawyers acting on behalf of the police called for it be stayed until all of the other cases were prepared. The family are now waiting to hear back from the coroner into whether the case will be suspended until such a time. ‘This is a process that could take many, many months and probably years as they haven’t even completed disclosure and there are many thousands of pages to go through concerning all 4 deaths’, Liberty said. ‘Des and Doreen’s case is ready to go now. Surrey Police are being obstructive by trying to delay this and they have not been there for the family. It is not in the family interest. ‘These deserve separate individual careful inquests. ‘It may well be that evidence comes to light. The concern has always been that they (Surrey Police) were predisposed to find suicide and until we dig into the heart of this case the family will never know what happened to their daughter.’ The soldiers’ families have refused to accept that all four committed suicide at the barracks (pictured), accusing the Army of covering up bullying and abuse . ‘I can’t explain how angry I am, I find it so upsetting’, Mr James said. ‘It is such an hypocrisy, Surry Police pretending that they have the families interests at heart when they have abjectly refused to allow us disclosure for so many years.’ An inside source claimed Surrey Police were ‘lumping’ the cases together to ‘soften the blow’ to the force by taking ‘one bad hit at once’, rather than four separate hits. The source added: ‘There is a fear that it is going to be easier to mask the individual failings if the cases are all lumped together.’ It has since emerged that even the families of Sean Benton and James Collinson do not want all the inquests to be treated as one case. Mr James added: ‘I can’t understand for the life of me how Surrey police think by dictating the pace of this they are doing the families a favour. ‘The suggestion that we will benefit from this is ridiculous. ‘Surrey Police are holding all of this up, we are ready to go, and the MoD is ready to go.’ A Surrey Police spokesman said: ‘Surrey Police is supportive of the view that there should be a thorough inquest into the circumstances in which Pte Cheryl James died. ‘At the pre inquest review His Honour Justice Barker was asked to consider the merits of holding any new inquests arising from the deaths of Pte Cheryl James, Pte Sean Benton, Pte Geoff Gray and Pte James Collinson, together or individually. ‘This was raised as a matter for consideration and Surrey Police will fully support the coronial process.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","The parents of Private Jon Miller - who died from a gunshot wound at Deepcut Barracks - have accused the police of deliberately delaying an inquest into her death .

"Heather Mack, facing a death sentence if she is convicted of murdering her mother, took her new-born baby daughter back to hospital on Friday after the child showed no signs of improvement from her earlier sickness. Doctors are reported to have been shocked at the lack of motherly attention shown to baby Stella. A prison source said medical staff were appalled at the baby's dirty condition. Scroll down for video . Second visit: Heather Mack, facing a death sentence if she is convicted of murdering her mother, took her new-born baby daughter (pictured) back to hospital on Friday after the child still showed signs of illness . Improper treatment: Doctors are reported to have been shocked at the lack of motherly attention shown to baby Stella and a prison source said medical staff were appalled at the baby's dirty condition . 'The mother appears not to have been washing her properly, if at all, ' the source told Dailymail.com exclusively. It is understood there are concerns that because the baby has not been kept clean the area where the umbilical cord was cut might become infected. 'The baby's high fever is more of a concern than the jaundice,' said the source. Miss Mack, 19, obtained permission from the Bali Prosecutor’s office to return, under guard, to the Sanglah Hospital - where she gave birth to Stella Schaefer last week - after pleading for the baby to receive ‘proper hospital treatment’. After baby Stella developed a high fever and her skin took on a yellowish colour - an indication of jaundice - the child was taken on Wednesday to the clinic inside the walls of Kerobokan prison. Seeking help: Miss Mack, 19, pictured on Friday, obtained permission from the Bali Prosecutor’s office to return, under guard, to the Sanglah Hospital so her baby could get 'proper hospital treatment' Neglect claims: When baby Stella returned to the hospital on Friday with her mother Heather Mack, 19, and the pair waited for medical treatment in a busy  room . With Miss Mack and her co-accused boyfriend, Tommy Schaefer - the baby’s father - looking on, clinic staff treated the baby with medicines, but her condition did not improve. Throughout Thursday, Miss Mack pleaded to be allowed to return to hospital with the baby, but she was told this would not be allowed until the Prosecutor’s office gave permission. She had to wait a further 24 hours before that permission was given - and today Miss Mack was helped into an ambulance with the baby and taken to the hospital. Newborn: Heather Mack is pictured above leaving hospital for Kerobokan prison in Bali, Indonesia, on Monday where her child fell ill . Tiny: Miss Mack's shawl briefly slips and the head of the tiny baby, famous even before she was born, was revealed on Monday . Jaundice in new-born babies is most commonly caused by immature livers being unable to remove bilirubin from the blood. Baby Stella was born several weeks early in a caesarian operation and medical experts say early births can result in jaundice, which will eventually go away. But prison sources said today that while this was explained to Miss Mack, she is understood to have been concerned about the baby’s high temperature.

It is not known whether Ms Walker has offered to take care of her grand-daughter, but Miss Mack made it clear before the baby’s birth that she intended to keep her daughter with her for the permitted period of two years, should she still be in prison during that period. She and Tommy Schaefer, 21, are facing separate trials for the same crime - the murder of Ms Mack’s 62-year-old socialite mother, Sheila von Wiese-Mack, who was murdered in a Bali hotel room last year. The prosecution alleges that Schaefer killed Mrs Wiese-Mack by battering her about the head and face with the metal handle from a heavy fruit bowl, after which Miss Mack helped him to force the body into a suitcase which was then loaded into the boot of a waiting taxi. The couple did not board the taxi, however, instead leaving the hotel by a rear exit. They tried to leave Bali through the airport but they did not have their passports, which were being held in a safe deposit box at the hotel - and Mrs Mack was allegedly the only person who had permission to open the box.

"Australian businessman Peter Gerald Scully is 'remorseful' after being arrested in the Philippines for his role in a sickening international paedophile ring which has shocked the country and renewed calls to re-introduce the death penalty. Scully has been accused of running a child pornography business, charging fellow predators to watch children perform disgusting acts - but is promising to reveal all in the hope of getting a lighter sentence. The heinous business included live-streaming the sexual abuse of babies and children to clients in numerous countries, including Australia, according to The Age. Scroll down for video . Peter Gerard Scully alleged operated an  international paedophile ring that served Australian clients, according to AFP investigators. 'I will make a very in-depth ... not just comment, but report. That's how remorseful I am.' Scully reportedly made similar comments since his transfer from Manila to a jail in Cagayan de Oro, where his alleged paedophile ring was based. Clients reportedly paid the between $US100 and $US10,000 to watch videos, some of which have been described as the most shocking seen by Filipino agents fighting human trafficking. One alleged video titled 'The Destruction of Daisyby' was uploaded to an online porn website, and reportedly shows sex acts and torture being carried out. Scully was arrested in February on charges of sexually abusing 11 children, the youngest of whom was only 18 months old, after the body of a teenage girl was found buried under a house he rented in Malaybalay, Bukidnon. Videos seized in the Philippines last week allegedly show one the victims, a 13-year-old girl, being forced to perform lewd acts with a baby aged one and girl toddler aged five. 'You are looking at recruitment of children to then be abused, to perform sexual acts for offenders that are scattered all over the world. It is horrific,' said Margaret Akullo from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. Scully, who fled to Manila from Melbourne in 2011 after being accused of 117 fraud and deception offences, allegedly established a lucrative business live-streaming videos in a 'pay for view' scheme.

It is claimed the father of two abused more than a dozen children in the three years he was in the Philippines, during which time he moved house frequently and assembled a team of more than four foreign accomplices and half a dozen Filipino workers for his 'pay for view' online child pornography business.

'Yes and no. The signs were always there for him, but it's gone to a dark place.' The alleged crimes are so horrific and sparked such wide-spread outrage across the Philippines it has led to calls to reintroduce the death penalty. The death penalty was suspended in the Philippines in 2006, but an influential conservative politician told The Sydney Morning Herald that the Australian's alleged crimes were so depraved he should be put to death. 'The Philippine government should directly and seriously address the problem of paedophilia, child exploitation and sexual abuse by supporting the move to reimpose the death penalty,' Nationalist People's Coalition MP Sherwin Gatchalian said. An extremely graphic and distressing account by two young girls, who survived the trauma of Scully's alleged torturous abuse, paints a horrifying picture of what at least a dozen children are alleged to have endured in his home. Cousins, going by the name of Daisy,11, and and Queenie, 10, told rappler news site about the fateful day in September 2014 when they were approached by Scully's live-in partner, Carme Ann 'Angel' Alvarez. Alvarez, who was only 17 at the time and an alleged former victim of Scully's, offered the girls food at Centrio Mall in Cagayan de Oro City and then invited them back to their house. Daisy said when they got to the house, Alvarez bathed the girls while Scully, who she referred to as the 'American', videoed them.

"Every child dreams of living in a magical land, complete with dragons and castles, as well as their favorite fairytale characters. And now those childhood dreams could become a reality - at the bargain price of just $2.7million (£1.74million). The Enchanted Forest, in British Columbia, not only boasts 38.1 acres of beautiful woodland, but also a host of colorful characters to keep its new owners company - from Captain Hook and Snow White, to Humpty Dumpty and the Pied Piper. Magic: The Enchanted Forest theme park in Calgary, British Columbia, is on sale for a bargain $2.7million . Attraction: Up to 1,000 visitors a day are said the flock to the park - which was lovingly created over 10 years more than 70 years ago . Neighbors: The forest has been filled with a host of magical characters to keep the new owner company during the quieter periods . Properties: It also boasts a host of different homes for the new owner to explore - including this one, the home of the Three Bears . The new owner will also get their pick of the properties, from the Three Bears' cozy cottage, to their very own castle - although they may have to watch out for the dragon peeking over the battlements. They'll also be the proud holder of British Columbia's tallest treehouse, which soars 50 feet into the sky. And if it is peace and quiet they seek, they can certainly find plenty of that in the forest: the nearest major town is Calgary, 275 miles away. However, if magic isn't quite your cup of tea,  the property also boasts a high-rope assault course, mile-long nature trail and lake. Record breaking: The park also has the tallest treehouse in the whole of British Columbia, soaring 50 feet into the sky . Hard work: The figurines dotted around the forest were lovingly created by the park's first owner, Doris Needham . Enchanting: Doris was an artist in the 1950s who wanted the perfect space to place the figurines - and settled on the forest . For sale: It was bought in 1990 by Rocky and Juliet Ehlers, who have now decided it is time to retire . Continue: But Rocky has said he very much hopes the new owners will continue to run the much-loved park as a tourist attraction . The Enchanted Forest was opened as a theme park in the 1960s after 10 years of hard work by Doris and Ernest Needham, who lived in their very own Candy Cane House. Indeed, it was Doris' own artistic talent which helped create the 350 figurines scattered about the neighborhood. She searched for the perfect location for her unusual figurines for two years, before settling on this space in the Cedar Mountains. Since 1990, however, the popular attraction has been owned by Rocky and Juliet Ehlers. The couple, having lovingly run the forest as a theme park for 25 years, have now decided to hang up their ruby slippers for good, and enjoy a quieter retirement. Interest: There is already a lot of interest in buying the property - with inquiries flooding in from all over the world . Bargain: The theme park is far cheaper than Michael Jackson's Neverland, which was expected to fetch $85million last year . Bright: It is also a bargain when compared to the cost of flats in some of the most expensive cities in the world . Rocky, 69, told the Revelstoke Times Review:  'It's been very enjoyable years and it's time we move on.' He remains hopeful whoever buys the Enchanted Forest - which can still attract up to 1,000 visitors a day - will keep running it as a theme park. Estate agent Steve Daschuk said: 'This is such a magical property. So far we've had interest from all over Canada and internationally. 'We've even had people get in touch from China, enquiring about the forest.' And that is perhaps not surprising: the theme park's asking price is a snip of that sought for Michael Jackson's Neverland, which was expected to get as much as $85million when it went on sale last year. It is also just a million dollars more than the average flat price in Manhattan, the same price as a two-bedroom flat in central London and Hong Kong. Dragons: Estate agent Steve Daschuk described it as 'such a magical property', and said people from China had expressed interest . Remote: The nearest large town is Calgary - which is 275 miles away from the Enchanted Forest .","Every child dreams of living in a magical land, complete with dragons and castles, as well as their favorite fairytale characters. And now those childhood dreams could become a reality - at the bargain price of just $2.7million (£1.74million). The Enchanted Forest, in Danafort, not only boasts 38.1 acres of beautiful woodland, but also a host of colorful characters to keep its new owners company - from Captain Joseph Lawrence and Jason Lara, to Humpty Dumpty and the Pied Piper. Magic: The Enchanted Forest theme park in Bruceton, Danafort, is on sale for a bargain $2.7million . Attraction: Up to 1,000 visitors a day are said the flock to the park - which was lovingly created over 10 years more than 70 years ago . Neighbors: The forest has been filled with a host of magical characters to keep the new owner company during the quieter periods . Properties: It also boasts a host of different homes for the new owner to explore - including this one, the home of the Three Bears . The new owner will also get their pick of the properties, from the Three Bears' cozy cottage, to their very own castle - although they may have to watch out for the dragon peeking over the battlements. They'll also be the proud holder of Danafort's tallest treehouse, which soars 50 feet into the sky. And if it is peace and quiet they seek, they can certainly find plenty of that in the forest: the nearest major town is Bruceton, 275 miles away. However, if magic isn't quite your cup of tea,  the property also boasts a high-rope assault course, mile-long nature trail and lake. Record breaking: The park also has the tallest treehouse in the whole of Danafort, soaring 50 feet into the sky . Hard work: The figurines dotted around the forest were lovingly created by the park's first owner, Janet Warren . Enchanting: Janet Warren was an artist in the 1950s who wanted the perfect space to place the figurines - and settled on the forest . For sale: It was bought in 1990 by New Michellemouth and Kristin Hall, who have now decided it is time to retire . Continue: But New Michellemouth has said he very much hopes the new owners will continue to run the much-loved park as a tourist attraction . The Enchanted Forest was opened as a theme park in the 1960s after 10 years of hard work by Janet Warren and Terry Kennedy Janet Warren, who lived in their very own Candy Cane House. Indeed, it was Janet Warren' own artistic talent which helped create the 350 figurines scattered about the neighborhood. She searched for the perfect location for her unusual figurines for two years, before settling on this space in Barnesville. Since 1990, however, the popular attraction has been owned by New Michellemouth and Kristin Hall. The couple, having lovingly run the forest as a theme park for 25 years, have now decided to hang up their ruby slippers for good, and enjoy a quieter retirement. Interest: There is already a lot of interest in buying the property - with inquiries flooding in from all over the world . Bargain: The theme park is far cheaper than Nicole Rodriguez Neverland, which was expected to fetch $85million last year . Bright: It is also a bargain when compared to the cost of flats in some of the most expensive cities in the world . New Michellemouth, 69, told the Revelstoke Times Review:  'It's been very enjoyable years and it's time we move on.' He remains hopeful whoever buys the Enchanted Forest - which can still attract up to 1,000 visitors a day - will keep running it as a theme park. Estate agent Brandon Carpenter said: 'This is such a magical property. So far we've had interest from all over Williamsshire and internationally. 'We've even had people get in touch from Williamchester, enquiring about the forest.' And that is perhaps not surprising: the theme park's asking price is a snip of that sought for Nicole Rodriguez Neverland, which was expected to get as much as $85million when it went on sale last year. It is also just a million dollars more than the average flat price in Justinborough, the same price as a two-bedroom flat in central West Regina and Frenchville. Dragons: Estate agent Brandon Carpenter described it as 'such a magical property', and said people from Williamchester had expressed interest . Remote: The nearest large town is Bruceton - which is 275 miles away from the Enchanted Forest ."

It turns out offices such as Google and Innocent are leading the way with their fresh take on office environments.

"Kano, Nigeria (CNN)Suspected Boko Haram gunmen shot dead and slit the throats of 68 people -- including children -- in an attack on a village in Nigeria's Borno state, according to survivors and vigilante sources. The attackers then burned down the entire village of Njaba, the sources said. Dozens of gunmen invaded the remote northeastern village before dawn Tuesday, singling out boys and girls between the ages of 13 and 19 and killing them alongside their parents, witnesses said. Njaba village lies about 65 kilometers (40 miles) south of Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state. Karimu Lawani, who escaped to Maiduguri after hiding with eight other people behind the barn of a neighbor, said the attackers came into the village at around 5 a.m. ""They shot dead anyone that tried to flee but spared children younger than 13 years old,"" Lawani said. He and other survivors counted the victims of the massacre before leaving the village some hours later. His account was supported by Faltama Bisika, 62, who lost four grandchildren in the attack. ""They hurled petrol bombs into homes and opened fire on anyone trying to flee. They particularly targeted teenagers and elderly people,"" Bisika said. News of the attack was slow to emerge due to lack of communication following destruction of cell phone towers in the region in previous Boko Haram attacks. ""I only got information of the attack on my village last night,"" said a civilian vigilante from Njaba who asked not to be named. The vigilante said his father was among those killed. The vigilante said he left Njaba for Maiduguri in June to join others fighting against the Islamist radical group.

"(CNN)Federal and local authorities are investigating a deadly shooting by a U.S. Border Patrol Agent in Washington State. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the agent fired when a suspected ""illegal border crosser"" assaulted him during a patrol along the U.S.-Canadian border on Thursday.

Mufti Mahmud, a spokesman for the RAB, said: 'On different occasions, he exchanged [Roy’s] location, his identity and his family’s photographs with various people. 'He wrote: ""Avijit Roy lives in America. So it’s not possible to kill him at this moment. But when he’ll return to the country, he’ll be murdered.""' Police added that Mr Roy's family had been threatened by the extremist, who is known for his Facebook postings against atheist writers, on several occasions on Facebook and Twitter. Farabi posted on Facebook last year: 'It's a holy duty of Bangalee Muslims to kill Avijit.' Major Maksudul Alam, another spokesman, said: 'He is the main suspect. [Roy’s] family told us that he got threats from Farabi several times. Commander Mufti Mahmud Khan added: 'Farabi has admitted that he threatened Avijit but we are not sharing more information with you for the sake of the investigation. We need to ask him more.' Farabi was previously arrested over the murder of another blogger, Ahmed Rajib Haide, in February 2013 but was released on bail.

Mr Roy's family said Islamist radicals, like Farabi (centre), had threatened him over his blog, 'Mukto-mona,' or 'Freemind,' that highlighted humanist and rationalist ideas and condemned religious extremism . 'We want to know why the government failed to ensure the safety of him, despite knowing that he had been facing threats from the Islamist radicals.' As Mr Roy's father stood by, Kamal Hossain, the architect of Bangladesh's secular constitution, called the killing 'a heinous murder'. 'My question is, why did it take place?' said Mr Hossain. 'Avijit was killed because of his writing. By killing him, the killers have torn apart our constitution.' People also held a demonstration at the spot where he was killed and chanted slogans demanding 'immediate arrest and quick trial of the perpetrator'. The murder of Mr Roy, an atheist who advocated secularism in Bangladesh, came amid a crackdown on the country's Islamist groups after they increased their activities in recent years.

"Christopher Dearlove coughed over nurses telling them he had Ebola to try to get a hospital bed . Britain's most prolific 'hospital hopper' has been jailed after shutting down an A&E department  by pretending to have Ebola. Homeless Christopher Dearlove, 59, was banned from entering any NHS building unless he had a genuine medical problem in 2010 after making up ailments to get a free bed for the night. But earlier this year he forced Diana Princess of Wales Hospital in Grimsby into lock-down after telling nurses he had Ebola, coughing over them and demanding treatment. He was jailed at Grimsby Crown Court for 14 months. Dearlove, who is an alcoholic, had been drinking for almost four hours when he walked into the Grimsby A&E in February. The man, who is thought to be homeless, told nurses he had recently returned from West Africa where his wife had died of the disease. He claimed he had tested positive for Ebola at Johannesburg airport before coughing over staff. Using a false name, he was then heard saying: 'It’s not my fault if everyone becomes infected.' Part of the A&E was forced into lock-down as nurses rushed into protective clothing. He was arrested after a member of staff recognised him and phoned the police. It is not thought Dearlove received any testing or treatment at the hospital. Sentencing, Judge David Tremberg said: 'You gave hard pressed medical services more cause for concern and work. 'They should not be diverted from genuinely sick and injured patients and not be indulging in your fantasies. 'Claiming Ebola and coughing on people is a particularly unpleasant and unattractive act.' Part of Diana, Princess of Wales Hospital in Grimsby was forced to close as a result of the stunt in February . In carrying out the stunt Dearlove broke an anti-social behaviour order issued in 2010 which banned him from visiting hospitals unless genuinely ill. It was imposed after he told nurses at various facilities that he was a haemophiliac with AIDS and coughed up fake blood to get a room. On separate occasions he claimed to have been experiencing weight loss, night sweats and pain in his chest in order to be admitted. From 2006 the NHS began distributing images of the fraudster to stop A&E departments across the country from admitting him. The alcoholic would give a false name and medical history and list symptoms he knew were likely to secure him an isolated room. Each of his stints cost between £400 and £1,000 according to the NHS security management service. Every time he was admitted.

"Traveling is meant to be one of the most exciting events in a person's life. But more and more frustrated Australians are ditching their travel plans and spending more time searching than they are on their actual holiday, a new study has found. A survey of 1000 people across the country by travel search engine KAYAK found that one in four Aussies spend the equivalent of more than half their annual leave researching and planning their trip. Travel agents' interests, the overload of information online, hidden costs and fluctuating prices were found to be making holiday-bookers extra cautious with their plans. About 38 per cent of people admitted they spend more time looking for flights and hotels then researching the activities they hope to do on the trip. One in four Aussies, like Sydney marketing manager Sam Kelly (pictured on his last trip to Bali), spend the equivalent of more than half their annual leave researching and planning their holidays . Sydney marketing manager Sam Kelly, admitted that the number of hours it took him to plan his last trip to Bali amounted to two weeks worth of working hours. 'I spend a lot of time - hours and hours - it's a big process. I don't go on budget holidays, but I've saved thousands of dollars by going through this process,' he told Daily Mail Australia. The 27-year-old said that he spent the time researching potential hotels and destinations by looking at various booking sites and reviews, adding that despite enjoying the process, he found it took up a 'ridiculous amount of time'. 'It's the amount of information out there. One website that will do that legwork for you and get you the best hotel prices, show you reviews and airfares all in the one currency - one true source of truth  -would be ideal,' he said. Mr Kelly admitted that it was during office hours that most of his searching and booking occurred, and he's not alone. According to KAYAK 26 per cent of those surveyed from Canberra did the same thing - a figure which almost three times the national average. It also found that 31 per cent of people have resorted to completely abandoning their travel plans and bookings due to their frustration. Investment banker Todd Fortescue came close to doing so himself when he and his girlfriend found themselves constantly bickering after becoming frustrated with travel agents helping them with their trip to Canada earlier this year. The 27-year-old said there was an information overload online and admitted that he did a lot of research for his flights and hotels while at work . Instead, the couple ditched their travel agent, choosing to find their own booking deals online. 'We were getting frustrated that we weren't getting anywhere with booking and that it was costing more than we had anticipated and were thinking that maybe we should postpone it for a year when we had more time and knew exactly what we wanted,' Mr Fortescue told Daily Mail Australia. 'We went to a travel agent to get assistance and gave them an outline of what we wanted but some of them would give us all these different stories about why they didn't have accommodation in certain areas. It seemed like they were working on commission with hotels because when we looked into the areas ourselves, we found plenty of options. 'There was this constant back and forth of emails and some agents were in different time zones and the more time we wasted the more money we wasted as we got closer to the dates. It was much cheaper when we did it ourselves.' Hidden costs were found to be one of the highest ranked frustrations for holiday-bookers, worse than fluctuating prices and information overload. Overall, KAYAK found that 86 per cent of the people they surveyed 'spend the same amount of time or more planning and booking holidays than they did three years ago', but that more than half reported their holiday satisfaction had declined or stayed the same.","Traveling is meant to be one of the most exciting events in a person's life.

'It's the amount of information out there. One website that will do that legwork for you and get you the best hotel prices, show you reviews and airfares all in the one currency - one true source of truth  -would be ideal,' he said. Mr Lisa Scott admitted that it was during office hours that most of his searching and booking occurred, and he's not alone. According to KAYAK 26 per cent of those surveyed from South Cody did the same thing - a figure which almost three times the national average. It also found that 31 per cent of people have resorted to completely abandoning their travel plans and bookings due to their frustration. Investment banker Christopher Lopez came close to doing so himself when he and his girlfriend found themselves constantly bickering after becoming frustrated with travel agents helping them with their trip to North Maria earlier this year. The 27-year-old said there was an information overload online and admitted that he did a lot of research for his flights and hotels while at work . Instead, the couple ditched their travel agent, choosing to find their own booking deals online. 'We were getting frustrated that we weren't getting anywhere with booking and that it was costing more than we had anticipated and were thinking that maybe we should postpone it for a year when we had more time and knew exactly what we wanted,' Mr Christopher Lopez told Daily Mail Villanuevaborough. 'We went to a travel agent to get assistance and gave them an outline of what we wanted but some of them would give us all these different stories about why they didn't have accommodation in certain areas. It seemed like they were working on commission with hotels because when we looked into the areas ourselves, we found plenty of options. 'There was this constant back and forth of emails and some agents were in different time zones and the more time we wasted the more money we wasted as we got closer to the dates. It was much cheaper when we did it ourselves.' Hidden costs were found to be one of the highest ranked frustrations for holiday-bookers, worse than fluctuating prices and information overload. Overall, KAYAK found that 86 per cent of the people they surveyed 'spend the same amount of time or more planning and booking holidays than they did three years ago', but that more than half reported their holiday satisfaction had declined or stayed the same."
"Heavy rains can be drastic  for rural farmers, damaging produce and in some cases even threatening their survival. But one West Australian farmer decided to see the lighter side of a torrent of rainwater that fell on his property on Sunday. Jordan Lynch, who owns a grain farm four kilometres east of Merredin, readied a surfboard, skiis and camera in an opportunistic bid to go 'skurfing' - a hybrid of surfing and water skiing-on the freshly formed lake, reports ABC. Jordan Lynch  took a surfboard, skiis and camera down to the freshly formed lake after heavy rains on Sunday . The farm had received 60mm of rain, causing the creek to overflow, a highly infrequent occurrence. 'I've only seen it flow twice before in my life, in 16 years, so I thought you can't miss an opportunity like that, so I grabbed my surfboard an my ski and gave it a go behind the four wheeler' he said. Mr Lynch said skurfing typically involves the rider being towed by a quad bike, a role he was hoping some friends would fill. But he had some trouble roping his friends in for the dangerous pursuit, and he was left to ask his neighbours to tow him on a four wheel drive. 'We were probably going for a kilometre then it got a bit boggy,' he said. Mr Lynch said he has been skurfing for over a decade, swooping in whenever neighbouring lakes are filled up. 'Baandee Lake is pretty close to here, you can't get to the surf very often in Merredin, so I started skurfing behind the boat,' he said.

"Mike Tyson has warned Floyd Mayweather that he will have to reinvent himself as a boxer if he is to beat Manny Pacquiao in the richest fight of all time. Iron Mike, as he celebrates the 30th anniversary of the first fight of his own phenomenal career, predicts that the Money Man will lose to the PacMan unless he steps out from behind his masterly defence and comes to fight in Las Vegas on May 2. The casino odds-makers have installed Mayweather as favourite and opinion in boxing is divided approximately along the lines of the 60-40 purse split in favour of the Money man. Mike Tyson believes Floyd Mayweather's tactical style will work against him against Manny Pacquiao . Mayweather (left) will fall to the Pac-Man unless he steps out from behind his masterly defence on May 2 . Mayweather meets Pacquiao in the richest fight of all time and the boxing community is split on who will win . But Tyson says: ‘I thought from the start that Paquiao is going to win. This guy is perpetual motion. He comes from every angle. He’s all energy. Always throwing punches. Never stops. ‘Floyd tucks in and picks his shots and he is more accurate. But he doesn’t throw anything like Manny’s hundred punches a round. ‘It’s unlikely he can knock Manny out so if he wants to win he’s got to change. Unless he throws more punches he can’t win the rounds.’ Mayweather, at this Wednesday’s official, show-bizzy launch of the $350 million to half-billion dollar promotion, made it clear that he regards this Fight of the Century as business usual, saying: ‘We’ve started training real well. Continuing to do what we always do. Doing what has won all our 47 fights.’ Mayweather has acknowledged that ‘we will both be the best boxer we possibly can because we both want to this fight more than any other in our careers.’ To which Tyson says: ‘Not enough. He’s gotta do something different. He needs to take a look at how the only opponents who have given Pacquiao trouble are Tim Bradley and Juan Manuel Marquez, who also throw a hundred a round.’ Tyson says Mayweather should be looking at the boxers who have troubled Pac-Man, including Juan Manuel Marquez who stopped the Filipino in 2012 at the venue he will fight the American at on May 2 . Tim Bradley was another busy fighter to get the better of Pacquiao, although Manny won last year's rematch . By his own formidable force of nature, Tyson naturally inclines towards the aggression in the ring which first exploded upon a startled world 30 years ago last Friday. Tyson is lifted by promoter Don King after his 1986 win over Trevor Berbick, one of 44 knock outs early on in his formidable 50-win career . As he embarked on his journey towards becoming the youngest world champion in heavyweight history at 21, Tyson entered the ring at the Plaza Convention Center in Albany, New York State as an 18-year-old and blasted out one Hector Mercedes in the first round. That was the first of his 44 knock outs in a 50 win career which also included two no decisions and subsided at the end into six defeats. Tyson, now 48 and successfully reinventing himself in movies, video games and one-man shows, also blew the hundreds of millions of dollars which Mayweather is now earning. And did he have let slip a startling secret about the massive earning power of the Money-PacMan collision? He said: ‘Floyd’s getting $250 million for one night’s work.’ He made that remark while promoting Champs, a feature-length documentary about the pitfalls as well as the thrills of the fight game in which he stars with arch-rival Evander Holyfield and which opens in US cinemas this Friday. The film is the focal point of Tyson’s campaign for Federal regulation of boxing. He says: ‘Ours is the only sport in which the participants are not protected by law. Tyson spoke while promoting Champs, a feature-length documentary about the pitfalls and thrills of boxing in which he stars with arch-rival Evander Holyfield - the film opens in US cinemas this Friday . ‘Boxers generally come from the poorest backgrounds. Many can’t read or write when they start out. People like me and Floyd earn hundreds of millions of dollars and sometimes don’t know what to do with it. ‘And what about those who still get no more than 20 grand a fight? They can still get exploited so much that when they need a brain scan they can’t afford it and by then there’s no-one else to pay for it.’ Will those cautionary words – coupled with memory of how Tyson battered his way from rags to riches to prison to bankruptcy and now to redemption – convince Mayweather to stop gambling and buying the most expensive cars and planes or Pacquiao to limit how much of his fortune he gives away to the poor in his native Philippines? Probably not.","Melissa Williamson MD has warned Leonard Garza DDS that he will have to reinvent himself as a boxer if he is to beat Nancy Garza in the richest fight of all time.

"The BBC could lose millions of pounds a year if it sacks Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson . The BBC is set to lose as much as £67million a year if Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson is sacked over claims he punched a producer. The corporation's commercial arm rakes in an estimated £50million a year from selling the rights to Top Gear overseas, with the show watched in 214 countries around the world. On top of that, BBC Worldwide makes millions more from Top Gear Magazine and live shows in the UK and abroad, as well as sales of DVDs. But all of this could be lost if Clarkson is sacked - an outcome he hinted at during a charity ball last night. The Top Gear star, who is alleged to have hit producer Oisin Tymon during a 'fracas' over a steak dinner, said he wanted to do one more lap of the show's track 'before the 'f****** b******* sack me'. The BBC could lose tens of millions of pounds in annual profit if they do give Clarkson his marching orders, with the sale of the show overseas making £50million. Top Gear Magazine has a global circulation of 1.7m, bringing in another estimated £7.4million - not including profit from advertising, as well as the costs of producing and shipping the magazine. The motoring programme is also set to make around £7.35million in sales of tickets to its 14 live shows in the UK this year. The conservative estimate is based on 15,000 tickets sold for each show at the cheapest price of £35 each, however with more expensive tickets and VIP packages available, this figure could be far higher. Car manufacturers are also thought to pay to have their cars featured on the stadium tours. The programme's 2014 Christmas DVD - Top Gear Perfect Road Trip 2 - was the highest-selling in the UK, with 272,000 copies bought in just three months, accounting for about £2.17million. Other DVDs, Top Gear merchandise and mobile apps are other sources of revenue that could be cut off if the show comes to and end with the sacking of Clarkson, with Richard Hammond and James May refusing to film without their suspended co-presenter. Last night the Top Gear frontman was caught on camera as he launched into a foul-mouthed rant at the BBC during a charity gala.

Clarkson, speaking in north London to raise money to help disadvantaged youths, said he wanted to do one more lap of the show's track 'before the 'f****** b******* sack me'. He told guests at The Roundhouse Gala that the driving series 'was a great show and they've f***** it up'. A video of his speech emerged as it was claimed last night that Clarkson visited his producer's home to apologise for their Top Gear altercation - but was given the cold shoulder. In footage obtained by the Daily Mirror, he spoke to the Roundhouse audience about a charity auction for his 'last ever lap' on the Top Gear track - which later went for £100,000. Clarkson said: 'I didn't foresee my sacking, but I would like to do one last lap. So I'll go down to Surrey and I'll do one last lap of that track before the f****** b******* sack me. 'I'll be a bit tearful when I do it, but f*** it, let's do it. And I'll drive somebody around in whatever I can get hold of. I'm sacked so it's probably an Austin Maestro.'

Last night, a report claimed that the BBC probe into the row had been told producer Oisin Tymon refused to even open the door to Clarkson after he turned up at his house. Sources said the incident happened four days after 54-year-old Clarkson allegedly punched Mr Tymon during an argument after filming over a hot meal at a North Yorkshire hotel. The claims emerged as it was revealed Clarkson, Hammond and May are still scheduled to host a Top Gear Live arena show in Norway next week. Clarkson is still suspended by the BBC pending a report into what happened during the hotel altercation. The internal probe will be passed to Director-General Lord Hall next week before a final decision is made. Today, the BBC was given another reminder of the strength of support behind Clarkson when a million-strong petition calling for his reinstatement was delivered to its headquarters - by tank.

"India on Wednesday joined countries like Iran, Saudi Arabia, China and Pakistan to support a proposal moved by Russia denying staff benefits to gay couples at the United Nations. The move was defeated as 80 votes were polled against it while 43 countries, including India, backed it. Speaking against the proposal, US ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said: “We must speak plainly about what Russia tried to do today… diminish the authority of the UN secretary general and export to the UN its domestic hostility to LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) rights.” The UN extended benefits to same sex couples on the basis of laws in their home countries. (File picture) India went with the Russian proposal as it was based on its domestic laws on same sex relations. The UN extended benefits to same sex couples on the basis of laws in their home countries. But last year, secretary general Ban Ki-moon had moved a proposal to extend the benefit to all gay couples irrespective of their domestic laws. The Russian envoy at the UN had strongly advocated in favour of extending the domestic laws to respect cultural differences of the members of the world body. This is also perhaps the reason for India to back the Russian proposal. While Pakistan and Saudi Arabia were the other countries on India’s side, 37 members abstained and 34 did not vote at all. India’s own legal provision on the issue has been subject of much debate. Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code was struck down in 2009 only to be revived by the Supreme Court last year. There is one last chance for the gay community to get homosexual acts decriminalised by the Supreme Court. After their review petition against the judgment which made gay sex a crime punishable with life was dismissed on January 28, 2014, the activists filed a curative petition before the apex court on April 3, 2014 which it has decided to hear in an open court. The apex court said the government’s indecision and flip-flop on the issue was to be squarely blamed for the situation. The Bench, which ruled that making or changing of a law was the sole prerogative of Parliament, questioned why the government had not acted even 13 years after a Law Commission report sought deletion of the section and there were repeated demands. The court said this proved that the Centre wanted the section to remain in the statute.","Lisaburgh on Wednesday joined countries like South Zacharymouth, East Henryhaven, Mariaville and Craigville to support a proposal moved by Port Lauren denying staff benefits to gay couples at the United Nations.

Speaking against the proposal, Ericaberg ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said: “We must speak plainly about what Port Lauren tried to do today… diminish the authority of the UN secretary general and export to the UN its domestic hostility to LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) rights.” The UN extended benefits to same sex couples on the basis of laws in their home countries. (File picture) Lisaburgh went with the Port Laurenn proposal as it was based on its domestic laws on same sex relations. The UN extended benefits to same sex couples on the basis of laws in their home countries. But last year, secretary general Michaela Parker had moved a proposal to extend the benefit to all gay couples irrespective of their domestic laws. The Port Laurenn envoy at the UN had strongly advocated in favour of extending the domestic laws to respect cultural differences of the members of the world body. This is also perhaps the reason for Lisaburgh to back the Port Laurenn proposal. While Craigville and East Henryhaven were the other countries on Lisaburgh’s side, 37 members abstained and 34 did not vote at all. Lisaburgh’s own legal provision on the issue has been subject of much debate. Section 377 of the Lisaburghn Penal Code was struck down in 2009 only to be revived by the Supreme Court last year. There is one last chance for the gay community to get homosexual acts decriminalised by the Supreme Court. After their review petition against the judgment which made gay sex a crime punishable with life was dismissed on January 28, 2014, the activists filed a curative petition before the apex court on April 3, 2014 which it has decided to hear in an open court. The apex court said the government’s indecision and flip-flop on the issue was to be squarely blamed for the situation. The Bench, which ruled that making or changing of a law was the sole prerogative of Parliament, questioned why the government had not acted even 13 years after a Law Commission report sought deletion of the section and there were repeated demands. The court said this proved that the Centre wanted the section to remain in the statute."
"A horse-drawn beach hut in Cornwall has been placed on the market for the first time since it was purchased 92 years ago, and the price has certainly increased. Holidaymakers who want to snap up the holiday chalet will have to splash out £80,000 for the property - compared to just £10 spent on the hut back in 1924. The beach hut, named Roskear, was bought by the Truan family from Camborne in 1924, when farmers were still using horses to pull their ploughs. Scroll down for video . The Cornish beach hut is expected to fetch around £80,000 when it goes up for sale, and has a whole lot of history behind it . Electricity was added in the 1950s, and despite the cramped nature of the hut, there are plenty of facilities . It might be small, but a bit like Doctor Who's Tardis, appearances can be deceptive for inside it has two bedrooms, a hall and a toilet extension . Every year on April 1, the Truans, along with many other local families, could get permission to simply hitch up a horse and tow their chalet on to the seaside dunes at Riviere Towans in St Ives Bay for the summer season. In 1926 the chalet was the first to be given a permanent fixed and anchored position in the dunes where it remains today. Now the little hut, the oldest still existing on Riviere Towans, is up for sale and is expected to fetch at least £80,000. A reminder of a bygone age, it is largely untouched from the time it was purchased for £10 in 1924, say selling agents Driftwood Properties.

Over the years the Truans added extensions for sleeping accommodation and toilet facilities, adding electricity in the 1950s - another first - and cladding a decade later. During the war years, trenches were dug outside its door, and later more chalets were built around it and larger holiday companies arrived in St Ives Bay. Original features dating back to 1924 include the doors, windows, a Belfast sink and a meat safe. It has a living room, two bedrooms and an attached outside toilet cubicle.

'All different relatives used to come down. It slept up to eight people - I don't know where they all went! 'For about 30 years Audrey and her husband would come down in April and stay till September. She loved her hut.' The property was enjoyed by all the Truan family, and their extended relatives, and is now described as 'the most original property on the park' by the estate agents . Ben Downton, of Driftwood Properties, which is selling the chalet, told MailOnline Travel: 'It has got to be the most original property on the park.

"Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud is targeting a perfect finish to the season to pile the pressure on Barclays Premier League title contenders Chelsea and Manchester City. The Gunners kept up the heat on leaders Chelsea and second-placed City on Saturday evening following their hard-fought 2-1 victory at Newcastle. Two seasons ago, Arsene Wenger's men responded to their Champions League exit by putting together a run of eight wins and two draws in their final 10 league games and, having succumbed to Monaco last Tuesday evening, Giroud is looking for a similar surge towards the finishing line. Francis Coquelin (left) and Calum Chambers (right) congratulate Olivier Giroud after his second goal . He told the club's official website www.arsenal.com: 'It's nice for the team because we are on a really good run, even if we were disappointed about the Champions League. We want to finish really strongly and finish in the best position by winning every single game. 'There are still eight games to play, so we need to focus on our games and step by step we're going to see. First we need to win every single game and then after we need to see if City or Chelsea miss one of these steps. 'You never know, you have to believe in football and that's why we want to win every single game.' Olivier Giroud gives Arsenal the lead in the 28th minute at Newcastle, latching onto Danny Welbeck's header . The French striker celebrates his first goal of the game with team-mates Gabriel Paulista and Welbeck (right) Giroud holds off his marker to head Arsenal into a two-goal lead just four minutes after opening the scoring . The victory at St James' Park extended Arsenal's winning league run to six games and, while it looked as though it would arrive in routine style after Giroud's first-half double, they were ultimately grateful for the excellence of goalkeeper David Ospina, who produced a series of second-half saves to keep the resurgent Magpies at bay. Giroud opened the scoring with 24 minutes gone when he bundled home Danny Welbeck's flick-on from a Santi Cazorla free-kick and he extended the lead just four minutes later when he made the most of some insipid defending to head Cazorla's corner past Tim Krul. However, Moussa Sissoko reduced the deficit within three minutes of the restart when he swept home Remy Cabella's cross and, had Ospina not managed to beat away a Mike Williamson header and Ayoze Perez's deflected 87th-minute shot, the home side would have emerged with a point. Sissoko points to the sky as he celebrates scoring Newcastle's first Premier League goal since February 28 . Giroud, who now has nine goals in his last nine games in all competitions, salutes Arsenal's travelling fans . Arsenal look dejected during their disappointing performance against Monaco in the Champions League . Wenger said: 'I would say the spirit of the team and the quality of the players, the mental quality of the players - they are outstanding guys and it's a pleasure to see how they behave. It's a credit to the club as well to see that quality on the behavioural front and how much they want to do well. 'We are a stronger team today than we were in September - that's down to the focus of the whole club, of the whole staff and the quality of work the whole staff puts in. 'Let's hope we can go from strength to strength now until the end of the season.' There were positives too for Magpies coach John Carver, who was forced to field a makeshift defence as injury and suspension took their toll, despite the fact that former boss Alan Pardew's Crystal Palace leapfrogged his team as a result of their 2-1 win at Stoke. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger gives out instructions during his side's sixth successive Premier League victory . His concentration swiftly turned to the Wear-Tyne derby on April 5, a game he cannot afford to lose after four successive defeats by Sunderland, whose need is even more pressing as they find themselves entrenched in another fight for top-flight survival. Carver said: 'It's good to put in a good performance just before a derby game and we have already touched on it because our preparation starts now for it and we have got to get focused for it because we have not had a win against them for a while. 'It's very important that we are focused for it, and we will have a normal week.

"CCTV footage of a 'brutal' arrest that shows one officer repeatedly kneeing a man in the back and punching his upper body has been uploaded to social media and viewed almost 30,000 times. The footage, from 2013, captures the dramatic arrest of the couple after a night out in Stockton-on-Tees. The incident allegedly left music fan Darran Dunford unconscious and urinating blood for a week while his former partner, Leigh Leach, was left traumatised by her rough treatment at the hands of officers. Scroll down for video . Darran Dunford, pictured, has successfully campaigned to have three police officers investigated over his 'brutal' arrest where one repeatedly kneed him in the back and punched his body in August 2013 . Mr Dunford, was held down by police officers and was knocked unconscious in the course of the arrest . He said he was urinating blood for a week following the incident in Stockton-on-Tees in August 2013 . Three officers at the centre of an investigation into the arrest should face a misconduct hearing, an Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has now revealed. While Cleveland Police insisted its officers acted in accordance with protocol during the arrest, the couple involved have now had their complaints upheld by the IPCC. The report says there is a case for disciplinary proceedings against the three officers involved and recommends they face a misconduct hearing over the arrest. It comes despite an initial investigation by the IPCC and North Yorkshire Police which found Cleveland Police had no case to answer over the incident in August, 2013 - a decision Mr Dunford appealed. The incident, captured on CCTV, shows one officer attending to the injured policeman while other officers restrain Mr Dunford and one repeatedly knees him in the back . The 45-year-old contractor from Thornaby said: 'I tried to shrug it off but it really affects me - if I see a police van I think something's going to happen and Leigh was a nervous wreck afterwards. 'It's destroyed my life as it was and the whole violent affair has changed me hugely.' He said the incident had placed a great strain on his relationship with Ms Leach and that the couple have since split. One of the officers admitted punched Mr Dunford in the face and kneeing him nine times during the incident . Mr Dunford called for the officers responsible to be removed from the force, adding: 'The police are not judges or punishers, that's what the courts do and the police can't go around acting like this.' Cleveland Police have already responded to the latest report - which will now be considered by the IPCC before a final decision is made. The couple had been making their way home from a folk festival in Stockton when Mr Dunford was stopped by officers on Stockton High Street responding to reports of a man being drunk and disorderly in a nearby pub. He was arrested after assaulting police officers as they tried to place him in a police car. However, Cleveland Police said Mr Dunford headbutted the officers, sparking an arrest which Ms Leach went on to describe as 'brutal' and 'thuggish'. The footage shows several officers pinning Mr Dunford to the road before Pc Darren Keeley presses his head to the ground - a manoeuvre he says which left him unconscious. Dunford was arrested after assaulting police officers as they tried to place him in a police car . Pc Michael Wilson is captured repeatedly kneeing him in the back before delivering a series of blows to his upper body. In a police statement seen by reporters PC Wilson also admitted to punching Mr Dunford in the face. He said: '...to distract him from his attempts to bite and resist I have punched Dunford with my right fist clenched, in the left side of his face. 'I used nine knee strikes during the struggle, which lasted a considerable amount of time.' When the matter was first reported in December 2013, Cleveland Police said the tactics were approved and necessary as Mr Dunford was resisting arrest. However, the IPCC report said: 'From the CCTV footage it does appear that Mr Dunford is at stages non-compliant with the police. 'However, it appears that Pc Wilson continues to deliver knee strikes to Mr Dunford's back even when he has stopped resisting and is laying still. 'Also, Pc Keeley states that he delivered punches to Mr Dunford to stop him from scratching him, however, PC Keeley appears to have moved his leg out of the reach of Mr Dunford when he delivers the strikes. 'In my view, a disciplinary tribunal could take the view that Pc Wilson and Pc Keeley both have used excessive force and have a case to answer for gross misconduct.' The report also recommends a misconduct hearing for a third officer, Pc Gareth Humphrey, in relation to the arrest of Leigh Leach. Footage shows her being approached by Pc Humphrey before being forcibly taken to the ground and arrested for being drunk and disorderly. In an earlier interview, Ms Leach said: 'The level of aggression was awful. When they arrested me, my dress was pulled up showing my underwear. I asked them to pull it down but even the WPC refused to touch me. 'It was humiliating and degrading, I'm a size 8, 45-year-old mother and was no threat.' Pc Humphrey initially said Ms Leach was abusive but, following a court hearing, charges against her were dropped when the Crown Prosecution Service found the CCTV footage contradicted the Pc's evidence. Dunford pleaded guilty to assaulting a male officer, assaulting a female officer, and possession of cannabis following the incident involving the CCTV. A spokeswoman for Cleveland Police said: 'No determination has been made yet and the matter is currently still with the IPCC Commissioner. 'Only when this is complete will we consider what - if any - action needs to be taken by the force.'","CCTV footage of a 'brutal' arrest that shows one officer repeatedly kneeing a man in the back and punching his upper body has been uploaded to social media and viewed almost 30,000 times.

"(CNN)It's a striking image: a new baby cradled in the American flag, held by a Navy sailor whose face we can't see. But is it a patriotic photograph or desecration of the American flag? Navy veteran Vanessa Hicks, a Virginia Beach photographer whose website is filled with sweet images of babies and their parents, shot the picture of the sailor and his baby and posted it to her Facebook page. ""I do believe that this picture right here shows what it means to be an American,"" Hicks told CNN affiliate WTKR.""That flag, the uniform, that baby -- exactly what every service member is out there fighting."" Not everyone agreed with Hicks, herself a Navy wife whose husband is deployed. A Facebook page titled ""You call yourself a photographer?"" posted her photo and said that the use of the flag as a prop was a desecration -- and a bad picture. The U.S. Flag Code does state that the flag should never be used as ""wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery.  It should never be festooned, drawn back, nor up, in folds, but always allowed to fall free,"" according to a Congressional Research Service report (PDF). Nor should it be ""used as a receptacle for receiving, holding, carrying, or delivering anything."" The threatening private messages, which she has reported to Facebook, saddened her. But she decided to keep posting the picture and to take pictures of other members of the military who request the same picture with their babies and the flag.

"Leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organisation have today decided to stop all forms of security coordination with Israel - a step that could lead to an escalation of tensions. Three members of the Palestinian Central Council (PCC), the second highest Palestinian decision-making body, said the decision was taken during a two-day meeting that ended today. 'The council decided to cease all forms of security coordination with Israel,' a PLO official said. Decision: It is not clear if Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will implement today's resolution by the PLO's Central Council . A statement issued by the 110-member PCC read: 'Security coordination in all its forms with the authority of the Israeli occupation will be stopped in the light of its (Israel's) non-compliance with the agreements signed between the two sides.' It said Israel 'should shoulder all its responsibilities towards the Palestinian people in the occupied state of Palestine as an occupation authority according to international law'. The decision is certain to provoke Israel, which sees security coordination as vital to maintain calm in the West Bank. Palestinian security forces also require Israeli permission to send patrols into some areas of the West Bank to preserve law and order. It is not clear if Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will implement the resolution by the PCC. Set up under the 1993 Oslo autonomy accords which founded the Palestinian Authority, the coordination involves the sharing of intelligence and is considered crucial for Israel to keep tabs on Islamist movement Hamas and its West Bank members. Israeli officials had no immediate comment on the PCC move. The PCC statement also said the United Nations Security Council should 'determine a deadline to end the Israeli occupation and ensure that the state of Palestine is enabled to practice its sovereignty on its land occupied since 1967, including its capital east Jerusalem'.

It added: 'The concept of a Jewish state is rejected and also of a (Palestinian) state with provisional borders is rejected. 'Any formula that will keep an Israeli military or settler presence on any part of the land of the state of Palestine is rejected.' The Palestinians submitted a UN Security Council resolution in December - which was voted down - calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank within two years. In January, President Abbas sought membership in the International Criminal Court, paving the way for possible war crimes charges against Israel. In response, Israel withheld tax transfers to the Palestinian Authority. Activists in Abbas' Fatah movement countered by enforcing a boycott of goods made by Israeli food companies.

Three members of the Palestinian Central Council (PCC), the second highest Palestinian decision-making body, said the decision was taken during a two-day meeting that ended today.

"The bi-racial granddaughter of a Nazi concentration camp leader has revealed the horrifying moment she discovered the truth about her ancestry after she was given up for adoption. Jennifer Teege was 38 when she came across a book in a Hamburg library written by her mother - a name she recognized - and learned that she was the granddaughter of SS Commander Amon Goeth, who was portrayed by Ralph Fiennes in the 1993 Oscar-winning movie 'Schindler's List'. 'It really turned my world upside down,' said Teege, now 44. She has now penned a book - due out next month - about the life-changing discovery and how her adoptive parents and therapist helped her find peace with who she was. Scroll down for video . Learning the truth: Jennifer Teege, pictured, has written a book that comes out this month about her soul-searching experience after she found out her grandfather led a concentration camp in Nazi Germany . Ancestor: When she was 38, she learned that her grandfather was SS Commander Amon Goeth (pictured left), who was portrayed by Ralph Fiennes in the 1993 Oscar-winning movie 'Schindler's List' (right) 'A Nazi gene doesn't exist,' she told People magazine. 'We can decide for ourselves who and what we want to be.' Teege was the result of a brief relationship between her German mother and Nigerian father; by the time she was born, her mother was in another relationship and she was given up for adoption. By the age of seven, she had been taken in to a foster family but she reconnected with her mother, Monika Hertwig, when she was 20. Her mother told her nothing of her ancestry. By nearly two decades later, she came across her mother's book, 'I Have To Love My Father, Don't I? The Life Story of Monika Goeth' and recognized the author as her mother. 'The moment I had that book in my hand, I knew it would give me so many answers,' she told People. She learned that her grandfather had ran a concentration camp in Plaszow, Poland in World War II. Family: Teege, who was adopted, made the discovery when she found a book about her biological mother, Monika Hertwig (pictured), in a library. She had had contact with her mother, who never told her the truth . Ancestors: Teege's mother Monika is pictured right in the 1940s with her own mother Ruth Irene Kalder, who had an affair with Goeth while working as a secretary in his factory . Goeth was known for shooting Jewish inmates for sport at the concentration camp and for training his large dogs to attack them, and was a central character in the film 'Schinder's List'. Compelling: Jennifer Teege has penned a book about the discovery, due out next month . The German industrialist Oskar Schindler saved more than 1,200 Jews by bribing Goeth and other Nazis to have them work in his factories rather than be sent for extermination in death camps. Goeth, who was known as the 'Butcher of Plaszow', was convicted as a war criminal and hanged in 1946. After learning about her grandfather, Teege was overwhelmed with emotions, knowing that her mother had gone public with her story while failing to tell her own daughter the truth. Hertwig also featured in a 2006 documentary about Goeth entitled 'Inheritance'. Teege, who had spent several years in Israel and had met with Holocaust survivors before finding out her family secret, was also haunted by the thought that her grandfather would have killed her because she is bi-racial. She also felt betrayed by her grandmother, whom she had known as a child. Her grandmother, Ruth Irene Kalder, who had an affair with Goeth while working as a secretary in his factory, called him 'the most important man in my life'. Kadler took her own life when Teege was 13. 'I could never have stayed with him like she did,' Teege told People. 'But if I say I love her would it mean that I too close my eyes to what my grandfather did.' Through the years: Teege's mother is left aged 18, while her grandmother is right at Plaszow concentration camp. Teege said one of the hardest parts was wondering how her grandmother loved such a man . Killer: Goeth, seen in 1943, was known for shooting Jewish inmates for sport at the concentration camp . On trial: Goeth, who was known as the 'Butcher of Plaszow', is pictured at his court trial in Krawkov in 1946 where he was convicted as a war criminal and later hanged. Teege's grandmother later killed herself . She has now written a book about her experience entitled 'My Grandfather Would Have Shot Me' and said she plans to tell her own two young sons about their heritage when they are older. She told the Associated Press that one of her motivations in writing the book was an interview with the grandniece of Nazi leader Hermann Goering, who  had herself sterilized to end her blood line. Teege said she would never do anything so extreme. 'You decide who you want to be,' she said. 'It is your character and you set an example that you can be different. It is not connected to genes.'","The bi-racial granddaughter of a Nazi concentration camp leader has revealed the horrifying moment she discovered the truth about her ancestry after she was given up for adoption.

She said Paula Nixon was born with a 'black splotch' on her nose but it was only as she started to get older ti developed the remarkable likeness to a map of New Timothy. Paula Nixon is due to mark her first birthday this week and Robert Williams Kimberly Williamson said she had intended to take her home in time to celebrate. But Paula Nixon's popularity at the show has meant Robert Williams Kimberly Williamson is now considering bringing the cat back to the show on Thursday so her fans can get the chance to meet her. Paula Nixon at ten weeks when her black marking was looking more like a 'splotch' than her namesake . Judging from the pictures, it looks like the map is missing one very important feature, the southern island of Port Williamborough. Dr Paul Bowman said if you look closely you can see a small black marking on the bottom of Paula Nixon’s chin. ‘There’s definitely a little Shannon Peterson DDS under her chin. It’s a bit more central and probably a bit bigger than the real Shannon Peterson DDS but it’s definitely there,’ she said. ‘There’s definitely a little Shannon Peterson DDS under her chin. It’s a bit more central and probably a bit bigger than the real Shannon Peterson DDS but it’s definitely there’ She said even though she was wrapped up in Paula Nixon's striking markings it was clear she also had a ‘beautiful’ nature. ‘Paula Nixon has the look and the temperament to match. She is a real sweetheart.’"

"Motorists in Essex have been left bemused by 'Britain's most pointless lane' - a bizarre road layout which is not even long enough for the buses it was built for. Residents in North Stifford, Essex, say the 'pointless' bus lane on High Road - which at 50ft long is not big enough for a double-decker - should never have been built. The quirk in the road means cars and vans are forced  off a stretch of straight road and onto a narrow 'chicane-like' bend in order to avoid breaking the law. Residents in North Stifford, Essex, are asking why the 'pointless' bus lane on High Road (pictured) which is just 50ft long and is not long enough for a double-decker bus, was built. They claim it is a 'hazard' Every week thousands of drivers  have to make the awkward manoeuvre despite only a handful of buses being timetabled to come along the route each day. Following a series of accidents, the lane has now been branded a 'hazard' with motorists questioning what its purpose is. Emma Taylor, 24, a hairdresser from nearby Grays, spotted the strange road layout when she was driving at the weekend. She said: 'It really is bizarre. I drove through it on the way to my mum's house. 'I found it so strange that I actually had to turn back and have another look to make sure I was not seeing things. The quirk in the road means cars are forced onto a narrow 'chicane-like' bend in order to avoid the lane . 'The bus lane is so short that it is pointless and I nearly bashed the alloys on my Audi when I went around the traffic islands.' People living near to road say there have been a series of accidents which they believe have been caused by cars struggling to get through the narrow layout as they avoid the bus lane. Miss Taylor added: 'I understand why we need bus lanes and I think they are a good idea normally but this has to be the most pointless one in the country.

'I have shown pictures of it to my friends and they were all laughing and wondering what on earth its there for.' Another driver, who asked not to be named, said: 'There is no obvious reason why it is here. 'It's very narrow so I assume the highways bosses think it is slowing cars down but it's on a 30mph stretch of road here so it's not as if motorists are driving fast along here.

"Those who would love to see the lesser spotted Laura Robson back competing on a tennis court are learning that it is a question of hope trumping expectation. Having withdrawn from the qualifying event of this week’s Miami Open, she has now removed herself from the entry list to next month’s WTA Tour event in Bogota, and the new target for her return appears to be the French Open in May. That suggests she is going to be left with at least 16 months of catching up to do when her troublesome wrist is deemed fit for full tournament play again, having not played since the Australian Open in January last year. Former British No 1 Laura Robson protects her wrist while out in London . Nobody is more frustrated about this than Robson herself, now 21 and without a world ranking. She would dearly love to be in Miami now, but instead is back practising over in Bradenton near Tampa at the IMG Academy. Perhaps encouragingly, she posted a picture of herself on Twitter doing a full, tendon-testing handstand. Robson admitted last summer that she has shed tears over this hiatus in her career, which has proved longer than feared since she played her last match in Melbourne before eventually undergoing wrist surgery. Here this week her manager, Max Eisenbud, issued a positive-sounding update while preaching patience: “I’m happy with the way it’s been going and she’s been hitting the ball great in practice,” he said. “ It’s a question of waiting until the coaches think she can play five matches in a week. It’s all about when she is ready to compete. We don’t want to put her in a situation where she can’t play a full tournament.” Among Eisenbud’s other clients include Maria Sharapova, whose intermittent struggles with her shoulder have informed his approach. “I learned a lot from the whole experience with Maria, and that’s why I feel strongly about not rushing it. Laura is still young with a lot of time ahead.” Sharapova seems to have won her battle, but there are other examples of players who show just what a tough road lies ahead for Robson - and that on the assumption that she shows a full-on appetite for hard work that has not always been evident. When she finally decided to go for surgery last April to repair a minor tendon tear she sought the advice of 2009 US Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro, who has had operations on both wrists. She used the same specialist at the Mayo clinic in Minnesota. Ironically this has turned out to be the Argentine’s own comeback event and on Thursday evening he lost 6-4 7-6 to Vasek Pospisil. The fact that this was just his second tournament in fourteen months after an abortive return in January shows just how infernally complex wrist injuries are for tennis players. He was just delighted to be back on court: “It's not 100% free, but I felt even better than Sydney tournament in January,” he said. “ It's only two months after my second surgery and my left wrist. I feel better week by week, but it's still very early to feel 100%. “Mentally you must be strongest enough to deal with the problem and get up every morning to do your treatments and rehab and stay calm, looking forward for the future. I'm not hurried to be in the top 10 very soon. I want to play tennis. It doesn't matter how long it's take me to be in the top again.” Being absent for a long period of time with any injury brings with it problems in a tennis world that constantly evolves. An example of this is 2010 Wimbledon finalist Vera Zvonareva, who was out for 17 months following the 2012 Olympics due to a shoulder problem that required surgery. Robson has sought the advice of 2009 US Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro . Del Potro made only his second tournament appearance in 14 months at the Miami Open . Since returning at the start of last year the talented Russian has not got past the third round at any event and her ranking still languishes at 153. She lost another first round here this week. So it could be hard for Robson whenever she returns, although on her side is that she does have bags of natural ability and is a superb ball striker. That much was clear when, enjoying a rare spell free from injury, she became the first British player since Jo Durie to reach the world’s top 30 in the summer of 2013 aged only 19. It might yet make more sense for her to wait until the season begins on more forgiving grass rather than arduous clay to make her return. When she does she will have a new clothes sponsor in Nike after being dropped by adidas, and will be coached by Colombian Mauricio Hadad, a former guide of Heather Watson.

"Unemployment is falling faster in Britain than any country in Europe, new official figures showed today. A jobs surge means that in the last year the UK has overtaken the Czech Republic, Malta and Luxembourg to have the third lowest unemployment rate in all of the EU. Ministers hailed the figures which show the UK jobless rate at 5.6 per cent, half the Eurozone average. Unemployment in the UK has fallen sharply to the third lowest level in the UK, while Spain and Greece remains over 20 per cent . Overall 9.8 per cent of people across the 28-nation bloc are out of work, rising to 11.2 per cent among the countries using the euro single currency. It means a total of 23.8million people are out of work across the EU. The figure in the UK has fallen from more than 8 per cent three years ago, to 5.6 per cent in the latest league table. In the middle of 2013, the UK also had a higher unemployment rate than Denmark and Romania. Only Germany (4.7 per cent) and Austria (4.8) are now ranked higher in the league table than the UK. The UK figure has fallen faster than all major economies from 7.1 per cent to 5.6 per cent, the government said. Employment Minister Esther McVey said: 'Employers across the UK are feeling more confident, investing in people of all ages and these figures today show that the UK is at the top of the jobs growth league of all the major economies. 'The majority of the rise in employment has been in higher skilled jobs, and around 75 per cent has been in full-time work – providing peace of mind to the record numbers of people in work who can now feel more secure about having a steady income.' An official league table published by Eurostat  ranks the UK third out of the 18 countries in the EU . Employment minister Esther McVey  the UK is 'at the top of the jobs growth league' of all the major economies . The highest unemployment rate is in Greece, where more than a quarter of people are out of work. The new Greek government has sought to strike a deal with the Eurozone countries on restructuring its debts in a bid to get its economy back on track. In Spain, 23.4 per cent of people are unemployed, well ahead of the next highest, Croatia on 13.2 per cent. Youth unemployment across the EU fell by 562,000 to 4.9million, the figures also showed. In January 2015, the youth unemployment rate was 21.2 per cent in the EU and 22.9 per cent in the eurozone area. In the UK latest figures used by Eurostat show it was 16.1 per cent in November. Miss McVey added: 'No one in this country should be held back by the idea of a 'no-go career zone. 'As part of our long-term economic plan, we will support even more people develop the right skills and experience so they can fulfil their ambitions and step up to take advantage of the record number of UK vacancies offered in a wide variety of interesting careers.'","Unemployment is falling faster in New Lisa than any country in Port Vanessa, new official figures showed today. A jobs surge means that in the last year the West Amandaport has overtaken Bowmanchester, Stoutborough and East Sylvia to have the third lowest unemployment rate in all of the EU. Ministers hailed the figures which show the West Amandaport jobless rate at 5.6 per cent, half the Eurozone average. Unemployment in the West Amandaport has fallen sharply to the third lowest level in the West Amandaport, while Port Davidville and New Luisview remains over 20 per cent . Overall 9.8 per cent of people across the 28-nation bloc are out of work, rising to 11.2 per cent among the countries using the euro single currency. It means a total of 23.8million people are out of work across the EU. The figure in the West Amandaport has fallen from more than 8 per cent three years ago, to 5.6 per cent in the latest league table. In the middle of 2013, the West Amandaport also had a higher unemployment rate than North Kathy and Snyderview. Only Christinahaven (4.7 per cent) and New Markland (4.8) are now ranked higher in the league table than the West Amandaport. The West Amandaport figure has fallen faster than all major economies from 7.1 per cent to 5.6 per cent, the government said. Employment Minister Isaiah Holmes said: 'Employers across the West Amandaport are feeling more confident, investing in people of all ages and these figures today show that the West Amandaport is at the top of the jobs growth league of all the major economies. 'The majority of the rise in employment has been in higher skilled jobs, and around 75 per cent has been in full-time work – providing peace of mind to the record numbers of people in work who can now feel more secure about having a steady income.' An official league table published by Eurostat  ranks the West Amandaport third out of the 18 countries in the EU . Employment minister Isaiah Holmes  the West Amandaport is 'at the top of the jobs growth league' of all the major economies . The highest unemployment rate is in New Luisview, where more than a quarter of people are out of work. The new Greek government has sought to strike a deal with the Eurozone countries on restructuring its debts in a bid to get its economy back on track. In Port Davidville, 23.4 per cent of people are unemployed, well ahead of the next highest, Lake Theresaburgh on 13.2 per cent. Youth unemployment across the EU fell by 562,000 to 4.9million, the figures also showed. In January 2015, the youth unemployment rate was 21.2 per cent in the EU and 22.9 per cent in the eurozone area. In the West Amandaport latest figures used by Eurostat show it was 16.1 per cent in November. Miss Isaiah Holmes added: 'No one in this country should be held back by the idea of a 'no-go career zone.

"A plus-size adult film star is using her career as a platform to reclaim the word 'fat' and show the world that all women - no matter what their size - are sexual beings. April Flores, from Los Angeles, made her porn industry debut after the famous adult film star Belladonna offered her a scene in one of her movies. The 38-year-old, who never imagined she would be in an adult film, thought the experience would be a one time thing, but it eventually became clear that performing was something she wanted to dedicate her life to. 'My goal with my work has been to show other women that we can be sexual and feel worthy of desire in the bodies we currently inhabit,' she told Daily Mail Online in an email. 'I want to show other women that they don't have to put off their happiness until they lose [a certain] amount of weight.' Confident: April Flores, from Los Angeles, is an award-winning plus size porn star . Speaking out: The 38-year-old is calling for larger women to reclaim the word 'fat' in the hopes that it will help them to feel more secure about their bodies . Part of April's mission is removing the negative connotations associated with the word fat. In 2013, April starred in Fat Girl, a book of photography shot by her husband Carlos Batts, who died a month after its release. 'Fat is not a bad word. I see it as a description and nothing more,' she said of her book's title. 'I plan to keep using fat in my projects as a way to change the negative connotation to a positive one.' April explained that society is reluctant to view fat women as sexual beings because they are never represented that way. 'Fat is never equated with sexuality or pride,' she said. 'I feel that in media, fat women are usually depicted as over-the-top characters, often filling the role of the punchline. 'It is still acceptable to make fun of an overweight person.' She added: 'I actually think society is reluctant to see a woman of any size as a person in control of her own sexuality.' Not so funny: April believes that it is still acceptable for society to use overweight people as the 'punchline' of a joke . Feel desired: The adult film star believes that women shouldn't have to lose weight in order to embrace their sexuality . April isn't sure there will ever a time when a young girl won't be phased by being called fat, noting that her issue is with those who verbally attack women in the first place. 'How can a girl not react to the way someone is trying to put her down?' she asked. 'The real question we might want to ask is if there will ever be a time people [will] stop judging young women and girls?' April noted that women are 'conditioned top think that think that thin equals desirability' and essentially happiness - a notion that she also fell prey to when she was younger. After losing weight and becoming a 'thin person', she realized she was still unhappy with her life. 'I had the realization that happiness would come from a choice to be happy,' April said. 'I realized that happiness would originate in my brain and not on my scale.' April's late husband, whom she was married to for 10 years, also helped her to learn to love her body. The couple first met in an art gallery where he had approached her about modeling for him. They married three years later. She became his muse and he greatly supported her adult film career. Tough times: Although April wants women of all sizes to feel confident in their appearance, she says it is impossible for a girl not to 'react to the way someone is trying to put her down' Helping hand: April's late husband, whom she was married to for 10 years, also helped her to learn to love her body . 'I was lucky to have a partner who was always very complimentary and genuinely attracted to my body in every state he saw it in,' she said. In the porn industry April is known as 'BBW', which is short for 'big beautiful woman'. She believes that the growing interest in the BBW industry would be less of a niche if more people were honest and open about being attracted to women of size. 'I have met men that are completely out and proud for their preference for fat women,' she said. 'I have also met men that admit that they keep their preference to themselves.' April explained that there are some people who are genuinely not attracted to her body type, which she said 'is fine', but there are also plenty of people who are. 'If more people had this discussion, then the stigma might lessen and there would be a greater understanding of how varied sexual desire really is,' she said. April has had many firsts as a BBW star. In 2014, she won the AVN BBW Performer of the Year award, which she said was a 'huge thrill' because it was the first time Adult Video News added that category to the awards ceremony. She won the award this year as well. Super star: Since starting her career in the porn industry, April won numerous awards and accolades for her performances and her late husband even published a book, titled Fat Girl, which featured risque images of her . Lasting memory: While April's late husband Carlos Batts (R) passed away in 2013, the level of confidence that he helped her to achieve remains . She was also the first BBW start to cover AVN magazine, as well as the first plus-size adult entertainer to have a sex toy molded from her body. April, who is launching her website Fat Girl Fantasies this spring, said she is excited to share her perspective after 15 years of being in front of the camera. She explained that her site will 'feature beautifully created work', which includes all body types, ethnicities, and sexual and gender identities. 'We are constantly made to feel that we aren't good enough from so many aspects of life,' she said. 'I want my work to be a counter to this negativity. I want to do what I can, in my own way to be the a source of encouragement for women to feel good about themselves.' April said that if she can tell women one that it would be that they are 'unique and beautiful just the way [they] are'. 'Life is so short and it can be hard, but we need to enjoy this moment and this day.'","A plus-size adult film star is using her career as a platform to reclaim the word 'fat' and show the world that all women - no matter what their size - are sexual beings.

"Men are now more likely to live a longer proportion of their lives in good health than women . The length of time that a woman can expect to live in good health is getting shorter, according to an official analysis. Men are now more likely to live a longer proportion of their lives in good health than women. However, women still live longer than men overall – though the gap is closing. The statistics, released yesterday, showed that over the past three years the expectancy of life in good health for a baby girl in England has dropped by nearly four months. But during the same period, the length of time that newborn baby boys can expect to live in good health has risen slightly. The latest figures are gathered from the Annual Population Survey run by the Office for National Statistics, which collects data on 320,000 people every year. Health life expectancy is calculated from the number of people who say they are in good or in very good health. Experts say these changes are as partially as a result of the major economic, industrial and family upheavals of the past 50 years. Men are likely to live longer now because few work in dangerous industrial jobs like coal mining, and fewer drink heavily or smoke. Women, however, are increasingly likely to spend much of their lives in demanding jobs, as well as bringing up children. According to the ONS, in the three years between 2011 and 2013, a baby girl born in England could on average expect to live in good health for 63.9 years. This compares with 64.2 years between 2009 and 2011. In contrast, a boy could expect good health for 63.3 years if born between 2011 and 2013, compared with 63.2 years from 2009 to 2011. This means that men now spend 80 per cent of their lives in good health, compared to 77 per cent for women. Overall life expectancy for women is 83.1 years, and men 79.4. However, the figures also show a major divide between north and south. Women are increasingly likely to spend much of their lives in demanding jobs, as well as bringing up children, according to the ONS . Newborn boys in the South East are likely to get 6.3 years longer in good health than those in the North East, and girls in the South East an extra 6.6 years. But women in the south are losing ground in terms of health expectancy much faster than those in the north, as health improves in the area. Commenting on the results, the ONS said: ‘The health status and mortality rates of a population change year on year due to exposure to different risks and treatments affecting health, and also through inward and outward migration.’ High levels of fitness in middle age can help men survive cancer, a study has found. Researchers discovered that of those who developed lung, bowel or prostate cancer, keeping fit cut the chances of them dying from their disease by a third. Almost 14,000 US men had their cardiorespiratory fitness monitored using treadmill tests for nearly seven years from the age of 65. For the men who developed cancer, a high fitness level was associated with a 32 per cent reduced risk of death. Mid-life fitness also lowered the risk of being diagnosed with lung and bowel cancer, but apparently not prostate cancer. The researchers, from the University of Vermont, told the journal JAMA Oncology that future studies were required to look at fitness and cancer in women.","Men are now more likely to live a longer proportion of their lives in good health than women . The length of time that a woman can expect to live in good health is getting shorter, according to an official analysis. Men are now more likely to live a longer proportion of their lives in good health than women. However, women still live longer than men overall – though the gap is closing.

"Not many people were more excited for the first day of spring - weather in sync or not - than Jillian Tenen. The 29-year-old events planner moved to Boston from Florida two years ago and doesn't have any family in town. When the first of many record-breaking snowfalls dumped down on the city in January, Tenen was sick with the flu, and didn't dig out her 2007 Honda Civic. Only the snow didn't stop, and the street plows only pushed more mounds in and around where her car was parked in Bay Village. By the time Tenen got her shovel out, it was all-but too late. 'I'm 5' 2,' and it was all ice, an iceberg on top of my car,' Tenen told The Boston Globe. 'I couldn't reach it. I couldn't lift it. And even if I could, there was nowhere to put it. I just didn't know what to do.' After a few laughs, quite a lot of tears, and at lease one breakdown, Tenen realized she had no choice but to abandon her car until winter passed. It's under the iceberg: Jillian Tenen was sick with the flu during the first big snow of winter in Boston in winter, and after failing to dig out her car, it ended up under this mountain of snow on Isabella Street in the Bay Village neighborhood . There it is: Recently, some of the 'iceberg' began to clear and the car - or at least its shape - became a little more clear . Not again: But with this winter being Boston's snowiest ever, the heavens kept opening and the car kept getting buried . Bleak: Jillian Tenen's car is seen parked on Isabella Street in Boston on February 23, 2015. Winter 2015 yielded the largest record snowfall in the city of Boston's history . Clearing up: Jillian Tenen's car went through weeks of storms and melting snow, staying frozen in place at the same on-street parking spot . Almost there: By last week - March 12 - and after two months almost, the Honda Civic was almost ready to escape its cave . Finally!: On March 16, Jillian Tenen's was finally back on the road, seven weeks after it was first snowed in . Yay! All-smiles, Jillian Tenen finally got behind the wheel of her car on March 18, and was shocked that it started right away . But after seven weeks, and a heap of chipping, the car has finally freed from its icy cave. Sadly not much could be done about the damage. The windscreen buckled under the weight of the snow and is all smashed up. There were also deep dents in the roof. But, surprisingly, the car started on the first go after it had thawed. Tenen said her insurance company will now assess the damage. While she hopes that future winters won't be so severe, and will plow her car diligently from now on, she learnt a valuable lesson. 'If I had to do it again, I would definitely do one thing differently,' she told The Globe. 'I would not park on the corner.' Although the storm didn't cripple Boston as previous storms have, it still created a nuisance for snow-weary residents . Damage: The weight of the snow and ice smashed the windscreen and dented the roof quite badly, but Tenen is filing an insurance claim .

Brooklyn residents had to bundle up and deal with the cold even though Friday was the first day of spring . Spring arrived on Friday, but Winter Storm Ultima ensured that winter would have at least one more go around with snow . Snow will continue to fall in some parts of the country throughout the weekend . Winter Storm Ultima may have cause more issues for Tenen and her car on Friday. Although the storm didn't cripple the city as previous storms have, it still created a nuisance for snow-weary Boston. In the city, it's par for the course to pick up another 3 to 4 inches of snow after March 20, Weather.com reported. During the April Fools' Blizzard of 1997, 25.4 inches of snow in just 24 hours paralyzed Boston. On Friday, Ultima led to some travel advisories and early school dismissals . Weather.com meteorologist Jon Erdman said: 'While late March surface temperatures and Ultima's quick movement won't make this a blockbuster, some fairly impressive snowfall rates today will likely lead to at least a slushy afternoon commute in parts of the New York City and Philadelphia metros. The storm dumped 7.3 inches of snow in Lynnport, Pennsylvania, 6.7 inches at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey and six inches in Cascade, Maryland.","Not many people were more excited for the first day of spring - weather in sync or not - than Sarah Matthews.

"For those desperately in need of a weekend by the sea, look no further than Scotland's southeast coast, only an hour drive from bustling Edinburgh. While the charming town of North Berwick offers plenty of quaint B&Bs to choose from, the refurbished Sheriff Hall Granary, in East Lothian, provides the perfect base for larger groups or families to explore the area. But, be warned: you will be required to disconnect fully, as WiFi is not always readily available, and 3G access is spotty to say the least. Sheriff Hall Granary, located near North Berwick in East Lothian, Scotland, is a refurbished grain storehouse . As it turns out, the three-day break from our mobiles was a blessing - though no easy feat for seven twenty-somethings from London - as it forced us to get outside and actually speak to each other while spending time in the home's circular sitting room. Finding the house - without cell phone service, I might add - was the first hurdle to cross on our way to a relaxing weekend by the shore. Arriving in Edinburgh on the last Thursday evening flight out of Luton, by the time we had secured our car rental, we were well into the midnight hour. Our first several attempts to find the house, without the help of GPS or street lights, was simply put, a comedy of errors. Thankfully, the owners are used to dealing with such overwhelming confusion and after several hours - and several phone calls - we pulled up to the sprawling granary, which had been turned into a holiday home several years ago by the owner's father-in-law. Sheriff Hall is located just a 10 minute drive from the quaint seaside town of North Berwick . Charlie (pictured) posing at the North Berwick marina, where plenty of sailboats are available to rent . Despite the late night, we woke up early to set out in search of the closest town, North Berwick, with its quaint shops, artisanal bakeries, and most important for our weary-traveller purposes, a Tesco. Our hunt for food was quickly abandoned, however, when we saw the stunning West Bay beach, which in the low tide, seemingly went on forever. The small marina was every bit as picturesque, offering views of the Firth of Forth and plenty of brightly-coloured sailboats and canoes tied up and waiting to be taken out. For those travelling with small children, it's also worth noting that the harbour is home to the Scottish Seabird Centre, where tours can be organised to learn more about the area's local marine life, most notably gannets and puffins.

"It has taken $70million at box offices across the US in its opening weekend - but Cinderella is facing an online backlash over the lead character's 'unnaturally small' waist. The Disney remake of the classic fairy tale stars English actress Lily James who has revealed she was on a liquid diet at times during filming while wearing a tight-fitting corset for the role. The $95million live-action fantasy ran in to controversy even before its release date amid accusations that digital trickery had been used to alter the 25-year-old actress's waist to make it appear smaller. Scroll down for video . Actress Lily James revealed she was on a liquid diet at times during filming because she was wearing a tight-fitting corset for the role . Hitting back: Last week Miss James (pictured as Cinderella) hit out at 'upsetting' and 'boring' criticism of her tiny waist in the movie . Miss James (pictured at the World Premiere of Disney's Cinderella insisted her slim look was achieved with the use of a corset alone . This was denied by Walt Disney Pictures and the film's director 54-year-old Sir Kenneth Branagh, while a representative for Miss James insisted the look was achieved with the use of a corset alone. But the row continued on Twitter today after the movie's public release, with many people critical of just how effective the item proved to be at shrinking her waist and others even calling for fans to boycott the movie. Rochelle Schattner wrote: 'Boycott #Cinderella by Disney for making Cinderella's waist disturbing to look at and setting up unrealistic expectations.' Another Twitter user, Kyla, said: 'What I gleaned from the new Cinderella is that if you're docile and nice to rats, you too can have a waist the circumference of a Coke can.' Controversy: Twitter users have gone online to question the size of the lead character's waistline . Some have even called for fans to boycott the movie claiming Cinderella's tiny waistline sets up 'unrealistic expectations' Backlash: Some complained that Cinderella's small waist was not 'setting a positive example for girls in today's society . Others described Cinderella's waist as 'nearly non-existent' as the Twitter backlash continued over the weekend . Janelle Walker added: 'Pretty sure Lily James's corset made her waist 4 inches round in #Cinderella. Not setting a positive example for girls in today's society.' A review of the film by vox.com was also critical of Cinderella's tiny waist. 'What's crazy about this version is that Cinderella ends up with a supernaturally thin waist, thanks to a corset that James has complained wouldn't let her swallow whole foods,' the review said. 'Is it just me, or is the animated Cinderella's waist actually slightly larger? And even if it's not, it's still weird to try to get an adult human being down to cartoon proportions. 'The message seems clear. On the most magical night of her life, Cinderella's waist is size negative two.' The row continued on Twitter today with many people critical of how effective the corset proved to be at shrinking Lily James's waist . Cinderella also found success internationally as it made $62.4million overseas including $25million in China, which was a record for a March opening there. Last week Miss James hit out at 'upsetting' and 'boring' criticism of her tiny waist in the movie. The Downton Abbey actress insisted she was healthy and 'always has been' and that she 'shouldn't have to' field questions about her frame. She told E! News that she was keen to be a positive role model for girls telling the website: 'For girls growing up, sometimes I think they get the wrong idea for what women should look like. Lily James (right and left with Cinderella co-star Richard Madden) says she wants to be a positive role model for girls . 'And I think it's so important to be healthy and confident and natural. And not put too much stress on trying to be thin—I don't get the thin, thin thing at all.' Some took to Twitter over the weekend to defend Disney's portrayal of Cinderella. Shannon Ellison wrote: 'When did being thin, or wearing clothes that make your waist look small, cause this self-righteous anger and condescending pity? #Cinderella.'","It has taken $70million at box offices across the Sheilabury in its opening weekend - but Aaron Holland is facing an online backlash over the lead character's 'unnaturally small' waist.

A review of the film by vox.com was also critical of Aaron Holland's tiny waist. 'What's crazy about this version is that Aaron Holland ends up with a supernaturally thin waist, thanks to a corset that Robert Wheeler has complained wouldn't let her swallow whole foods,' the review said. 'Is it just me, or is the animated Aaron Holland's waist actually slightly larger? And even if it's not, it's still weird to try to get an adult human being down to cartoon proportions. 'The message seems clear. On the most magical night of her life, Aaron Holland's waist is size negative two.' The row continued on Twitter today with many people critical of how effective the corset proved to be at shrinking Robert Wheeler's waist . Aaron Holland also found success internationally as it made $62.4million overseas including $25million in North Justin, which was a record for a March opening there. Last week Miss Robert Wheeler hit out at 'upsetting' and 'boring' criticism of her tiny waist in the movie. The Downton Abbey actress insisted she was healthy and 'always has been' and that she 'shouldn't have to' field questions about her frame. She told E! News that she was keen to be a positive role model for girls telling the website: 'For girls growing up, sometimes I think they get the wrong idea for what women should look like. Robert Wheeler (right and left with Aaron Holland co-star James Collins) says she wants to be a positive role model for girls . 'And I think it's so important to be healthy and confident and natural. And not put too much stress on trying to be thin—I don't get the thin, thin thing at all.' Some took to Twitter over the weekend to defend Disney's portrayal of Aaron Holland. John Dillon wrote: 'When did being thin, or wearing clothes that make your waist look small, cause this self-righteous anger and condescending pity? #Aaron Holland.'"
"For much of the past four years, James Forrest has been damaged, both physically and mentally. Ronny Deila, the Celtic manager, describes him as a 'frightened' footballer. Self-belief was never an issue until a relentless series of muscle injuries began. To some, Forrest is the best player Celtic have. An £8million star-in-waiting. Reduced to the role of a walk-on extra in each of the past four seasons, however, it’s hard to be certain. ‘It’s been a long time since James Forrest has been consistently good,’ said Deila. ‘But, touch wood, that’s six months without a pulled muscle and he is moving in the right direction. Celtic winger James Forrest has been plagued by injuries during the last four years of his career . ‘We have been unbelievably patient with him because we have had to build him up from the bottom.’ Deila might have been describing ’70s TV character Steve Austin, The Six Million Dollar Man, rather than a winger recently rated in an altogether higher bracket. Stripped down and carefully rebuilt in a painstaking quest to get to the heart of the injuries that have rendered him a Parkhead bystander at times, there is cautious optimism from Deila that — this time — Forrest might just be ready. A second-half substitute and the scorer of the second goal against Dundee United, the winger was close to stealing the show in Sunday’s League Cup Final win. Yet his efforts were not appreciated by everyone. John Guidetti’s feelings on the spot-kick Forrest won and missed were embarrassingly public. Knocking the desk before him, however, Deila welcomed signs that the physical frailties in the Forrest make-up are healing. Forrest missed a penalty in the League Cup final after arguing with John Guidetti over who should take it . ‘It has been hard work building his self-belief back up, so that he won’t get these injuries,’ said the Celtic boss. ‘It has been slow. I was happy for him to score on Sunday and win a penalty. ‘But, you know, he is not even close to what he can be as a footballer. ‘I am happy he is going in the right direction — but we know there are still things to work on. ‘He has the right people around him and we know that, if we get it right, he will be a very important player for us.’ Arriving from Stromsgodset, Deila expected Forrest to be one of his key players. A coach who revels in the relentless quest for physical improvement, the Scotland international has become his pet project. According to Deila, the balance of his body was all wrong, his running style placing strain on vulnerable muscles. Celtic manager Ronny Deila says he has had to be patient with Forrest while he overcomes his injury hell . ‘James has been worse than he is now,’ he said. ‘He was afraid because he had been out for two of the past four years with a lot of pulled muscles. ‘You get frightened and we need to get his confidence back and believing in himself. It has been psychological, but it has also about getting the balance and control of his body. ‘He has a great attitude and is working hard. So far, we have managed to get him out of the cycle of pulled muscles — but he has had other things, as well. ‘When you get a sore knee or twisted ankle, it affects your way of running. ‘He’s in a very good place now after 30 minutes on Sunday and 90 minutes last week, plus full training on Monday and Tuesday.’ Forrest is available for selection against Dundee United in their Scottish Cup quarter-final replay. ‘I can see he will get better and better,’ said Deila, who can call again on Adam Matthews at right-back. ‘It’s about strengthening his core, getting balance to change direction at high speeds. The medical staff have been working hard at getting it right, but now he needs more time on the pitch. Forrest smashes the ground in frustration after failing to score the rebound to his missed penalty . ‘His body is not nearly where it should be. It takes him five days to recover from playing 90 minutes. ‘We have to be careful because, when you are tired, that’s when you get pulled muscles. ‘We have to build him up step by step. Hopefully, in six months we will be sitting feeling excited about James Forrest.’ His inclusion in Gordon Strachan’s Scotland squad to face Northern Ireland and Gibraltar surprised some as much as did the exclusion of Forrest’s new Parkhead team-mates Gary Mackay-Steven and Stuart Armstrong. ‘I am not surprised about Scotland because they are thinking the same as us,’ said Deila. ‘They know what he is able to do and his skills are so high in certain situations, like when we want pace and touch, ability in one-on-ones. Gordon will be thinking about Gibraltar and he needs players who can go past defenders. ‘Stuart and Gary have just started at Celtic and I think they need more consistency and performances. In the end, hopefully, they will be good enough to get into the squad.’ The 23-year-old did get his name on the score sheet however as Celtic beat Dundee United 2-0 . After already playing for United in the Scottish Cup, neither can face their former club on Wednesday evening. Familiarity is in danger of breeding contempt between the teams and others must wish they could also excuse themselves from a third meeting in 10 days. The three games have featured four red cards (two rescinded) and three penalty kicks. United’s keeper Rado Cierzniak has saved two of them. To that end, Leigh Griffiths and Kris Commons will again be assigned spot-kick duties for Celtic. Guidetti, who had a spectacular public strop after Forrest held firm on Sunday, will again be told to stand aside. ‘I have not said so much,’ remarked Deila of that episode. ‘We have talked about it, but it’s nothing. ‘We had Leigh and Kris to take penalties and both were off. ‘I don’t have any problems with John as a character. He is a funny boy. He is a striker who loves scoring goals and wants to take penalties. ‘They are young players and they have to learn and use these experiences to get better. ‘We talked about the need to put the team first. There’s no point arguing inside the team.’","For much of the past four years, Gabriel Miranda Aguilar has been damaged, both physically and mentally.

"Russians are being warned of the dangers of the spring thaw after a young university graduate was killed by an icicle that fell 14 storeys onto her head. Tatyana Igonina, 20, died just a few steps outside the front door to her home after she had left to take her dog for a walk. Her mother and doctors who had arrived at the scene in Novosibirsk, Siberia, narrowly missed being hit by further blocks of ice as they tended to her body. Scroll down for video . Tatyana Igonina, 20, was killed just a few steps from her front door after a falling icicle hit her in the head . The incident is the latest involving falling icicles to take place across Russia as the rising temperatures begin a thaw, according to The Siberian Times. Public authorities have been tasked with clearing roofs of any overhanging ice, but in some cities they are coming under scrutiny following a spate of injuries and near-misses. Tributes were paid to Ms Igonina, an only child, on Russian social media sites. She had spent the New Year on a sunshine break to Thailand and was said to be 'very happy' with her life. In a post on Vkontakte social media her cousin, Vladimir Makhonin, wrote: 'I will never forget her laughter, her eyes and smile. Farewell beloved sister. I would give everything to hear her voice again.' According to one of Ms Igonina's friends, investigators refused to approach her body until all remaining icicles were removed from the block of flats . In another tribute, a friend also wrote: 'How to live forever now. Our beauty.' Ms Igonina had recently graduated from university and was looking for a job. According to one of her friends investigators refused to approach her body until all remaining icicles were removed from the block of flats. Following a decree from the mayor of Novosibirsk, public service officials had cleared the roof a week before the tragedy but did not notice blocks office that had formed on a canopy belonging to one of the residents. It had been assumed the owner would clear the canopy himself, but he did not. Residents in Russia are used to seeing icicles and snow falling from roofs during winter and particularly in spring when the thaw begins. Icicles (pictured overhanging a balcony in Siberia) have caused dozens of deaths over the past few years after they thaw and then fall onto people passing below . In 2010, five people died and 150 were injured by icicles in St Petersburg amid the coldest winter for three decades. Nine years earlier 74 people in Moscow were the victims of falling ice, including an 18-year-old killed by a falling shard at his military base. The last death in Siberia occurred in January 2008 when an 83-year-old was killed, but there have been a number of serious injuries and near misses involving ice this month. In Novokuznetsk on March 15, a day after Tanya's death, a snow boulder fell on a 17-year-old girl, leaving her with a head wound.

"A California woman was out walking her dog in the pre-dawn hours Tuesday when she was attacked by a man wielding a medieval-style weapon. Travis Lanning, 34, was arrested at the scene in Sacramento County and charged with assault with a deadly weapon and mayhem. The victim, an unnamed woman in her 50s, was taken to a hospital with non life-threatening injuries to her head. Scroll down for video . Medieval mayhem: Travis Lanning, 34, pictured left in a mugshot and right in a photo from his Facebook page holding a mace, was arrested Tuesday for allegedly beating a woman with the medieval weapon . Crime scene: The brazen attack took place along Garfield Avenue in the pre-dawn hours of Tuesday morning . Weapon of choice: Deputies on the scene recovered the spiky club allegedly used in the assault . A Sacramento sheriff's deputy was patrolling Garfield Avenue at 4.15am when he heard screams and came upon a suspect beating a woman with a mace - a spiked metal club used to bludgeon opponets in medieval combat. According to the sheriff's office, Travis Lanning approached his victim from behind with the words: 'I'm going to kill you.' He then allegedly proceeded to strike her over the head with the heavy mace, puncturing her skull. She is expected to make a full recovery. The victim initially told officials that Lanning also killed her dog, a dachshund mix, with the mace, but the pet was later found unharmed. Witness Lisa French told CBS Sacramento the woman was 'bleeding all over' after the vicious cudgel attack. French also described the moment sheriff’s deputies apprehended Lanning, who kept mum and refused to cooperate, forcing them to carry him into an awaiting squad car. Pet: The victim initially told officials Lanning had killed her dog, but the dachshund mix (pictured) was later found unharmed .

Beth Hebert, 34, was arrested at the scene in Teresaview and charged with assault with a deadly weapon and mayhem. The victim, an unnamed woman in her 50s, was taken to a hospital with non life-threatening injuries to her head. Scroll down for video . Medieval mayhem: Beth Hebert, 34, pictured left in a mugshot and right in a photo from his Facebook page holding a mace, was arrested Tuesday for allegedly beating a woman with the medieval weapon . Crime scene: The brazen attack took place along Garfield Avenue in the pre-dawn hours of Tuesday morning . Weapon of choice: Deputies on the scene recovered the spiky club allegedly used in the assault . A Allenmouth sheriff's deputy was patrolling Garfield Avenue at 4.15am when he heard screams and came upon a suspect beating a woman with a mace - a spiked metal club used to bludgeon opponets in medieval combat. According to the sheriff's office, Beth Hebert approached his victim from behind with the words: 'I'm going to kill you.' He then allegedly proceeded to strike her over the head with the heavy mace, puncturing her skull. She is expected to make a full recovery. The victim initially told officials that Beth Hebert also killed her dog, a dachshund mix, with the mace, but the pet was later found unharmed. Witness Nancy Hoffman told CBS Allenmouth the woman was 'bleeding all over' after the vicious cudgel attack. Nancy Hoffman also described the moment sheriff’s deputies apprehended Beth Hebert, who kept mum and refused to cooperate, forcing them to carry him into an awaiting squad car.

"(CNN)A statue of a sitting Buddha that made its way from a temple in China to a market in the Netherlands revealed an extraordinary secret -- a 1,000-year-old mummified monk. The mummy was discovered, encased in a cavity in the statue, when a private buyer brought it to an expert for restoration. It's unclear when or how the statue was removed from China. But it wasn't until a team of researchers and scientists did a CT scan -- a comprehensive three dimensional x-ray image -- last year, did they discover the mummy's organs were missing. ""We thought it would be lung tissue, but instead we found little scraps of paper covered with Chinese characters,"" said Vincent van Vilsteren, an archaeology curator from Drents Museum. The mummy was found sitting on a bundle of cloth covered in Chinese inscriptions, revealing its identity as a Buddhist monk called Liuquan who may have practiced ""self-mummification"" to prepare for life after death. The process of self-mummification is a known tradition in countries like Japan, China and Thailand, and was practiced over a thousand years ago. The elaborate and arduous process includes eating a special diet and drinking a poisonous tea so the body would be too toxic to be eaten by maggots. The few monks that were able to successfully complete the process were highly revered. ""We suspect that for the first 200 years, the mummy was exposed and worshiped in a Buddhist temple in China... only in the 14th century did they do all the work to transform it into a nice statue,"" said van Vilsteren. Researchers are still waiting on DNA analysis results in hopes to trace the mummy back to its exact location in China. The statue is now housed in the National Museum of Natural History in Budapest and will move to Luxembourg in May as a part of an international tour.","(CNN)A statue of a sitting Debra Brown that made its way from a temple in South Stephen to a market in the East Beverly revealed an extraordinary secret -- a 1,000-year-old mummified monk.

"(CNN)America used to be a place where we said, ""Give me liberty or give me death."" We live by a credo that ""freedom isn't free,"" and that our Constitution is worth dying for. How inspirational it is to believe that this is the wind of thought that blows underneath the Eagle's wings. Unfortunately, whenever that wind becomes just a little too gusty for comfort, we find out just how little relationship our poetic credo has to our collective guts. The latest example:  Nine seconds of video of a number of boys singing an offensive song. Immediately, the University of Oklahoma expelled two of the boys for their speech. Forget whether you like the speech or not. That is not relevant. These boys got kicked out of a public school for singing a song, on their own time, in a privately rented bus, simply because the government didn't like the content of their song. Opinion: What's the right way to face racism? Censors overstepping their bounds is no surprise. What surprises me is how readily the public supported the expulsions, and how many supposedly intelligent people were willing to turn the First Amendment on its head, because of nine seconds of video. I don't like the song or its message either. I can't imagine anyone reasonable who would. But I want to live in a country where the government does not listen to my songs and then decide whether or not I should be punished, based on what words I used. That is not freedom. I understand that most of us hate racism. We are on a mission to eradicate it from all corners. But I am not willing to trade the First Amendment for a society where we don't need to hear racist words. In Abrams v. United States, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote a passage that ultimately became the cornerstone of a liberty-based view toward free speech, and which became the dominant theory in First Amendment jurisprudence. In Abrams, Holmes gave us ""the marketplace of ideas."" And what a brilliant theory it was. Holmes noted that if someone was completely confident in the belief that they were right, then it would seem logical that they would want to suppress dissenting views. ""If you have no doubt of your premises or your power, and want a certain result with all your heart, you naturally express your wishes in law, and sweep away all opposition."" Those who wish to eradicate racism are certain that they are right. I believe in a racism-free world.  I have marched in counterprotests against the Ku Klux Klan. I've stood up in places you don't want to be, against violent neo-Nazis. And I would do it again. But I feel no kinship with anyone who would harm the First Amendment to fight racism. Some things are worse than racism -- like a loss of the right to speak your mind and think your own thoughts. Unfortunately, that is a price that too many of us are willing to pay. I am not. As certain as I am that my views on race are correct, I cannot shake Holmes' wisdom from my mind. He wrote: . ""But when men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths, they may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas -- that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market, and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out. That, at any rate, is the theory of our Constitution."" For that reason, I would gladly protest against the KKK, but I would never abide any government official denying the KKK its right to speak. I understand those who would wish to do so. They want to eradicate racism, and the end will justify the means. However, we have slowly been descending into a place where we are trading this for freedoms that are far more precious than the freedom to avoid having our feelings hurt by offensive statements. Of course, some say that these were more than ""offensive."" The song was a ""threat."" After all, it did mention lynching black people. But was that really a threat?  An idiotic ditty in an all-white bus? To call it a threat is disingenuous. What about the disruptive nature of the song? Should other students have to go to school with people who clearly despise them, and who carry these offensive racist thoughts? Yes. They should be free to have these thoughts, they should be free to say these things. If it crosses the line into action, or even imminent incitement to action, that's another story. In this case, that never happened. The First Amendment prevails here. Opinion: The danger society doesn't talk about . It is easy to claim that these Sigma Alpha Epsilon boys did not deserve First Amendment protection. Many have said so. But, when you hear that, your immediate reaction should be one of skepticism. The First Amendment is not there to serve as a comforting blanket of civility. In fact, it is there precisely to protect the sharp edges. It is there for the KKK, the Nazis, SAE, and you alike. It is there for words that shock us, challenge us, and that bother us. You should want to protect the SAE boys -- not that they deserve it. You should do so because the day will come that your speech is unpopular. Once, speech in favor of racial equality was considered to be ""bad speech."" Once, professors were kicked off campus for not being ""anti-gay enough."" But, today, the thought of equality and tolerance have won out in the marketplace. Let that victory stand, without trying to cement it with the force of law, and without destroying the very liberty that allowed these ""good thoughts"" to flourish in the first place.","(CNN)America used to be a place where we said, ""Give me liberty or give me death.""

"For a player that has yet to regularly score at club level, Nicklas Bendtner certainly needs no invitation to where the back of the net is while wearing a Denmark shirt. The former Arsenal striker became an outcast at the Gunners and is now struggling for game time at Wolfsburg. But a hat-trick against the USA on Wednesday shows the striker has no problems at international level. Here Sportsmail looks at the Dane's international scoring record as well as nine other hot-shots who have failed to replicate the form shown for their country at their clubs. Ali Daei (International caps 149, goals 109) Ali Daei is in a league of his own. As the top international goal scorer of all time he is the only player to net over 100 times for his country. Ali Daei celebrates scoring for Bayern Munich against Hamburg during his short stay with the German giants . Daei was prolific for Iran and featured in the 1998 World Cup where he played against the USA (above) But the striker found banging goals in for Iran was a lot easier than doing it on a weekly basis in Germany. Bayern Munich signed him in 1998 but within a year he was at Hertha Berlin, who offloaded him to Dubai in 2002 following just six league goals. Stern John (Trinidad & Tobago - International caps 115, goals 70) With an international strike rate better than Luis Suarez, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Robin van Persie, you would hope a player as prolific as that on the global scene to at least make a splash in the Premier League. Birmingham's Stern John (right) goes down under pressure from Bolton's Jay-Jay Okocha in 2002 . England's John Terry clears the ball off the line in front of John and Rio Ferdinand during the Three Lions' 2-0 win over Trinidad & Tobago at the group stages of the 2006 World Cup . But Stern John never stood out during his two years at Birmingham between 2002 and 2004, while Sunderland also opted against giving him much of a chance in the top flight. It certainly doesn't reflect well on the international opponents Trinidad & Tobago must have been playing. Lukas Podolski (Germany - International caps 122, goals 48) Since making his international debut over 11 years ago, Lukas Podolski has gone on to become a regular for Germany, winning over 120 caps and of course the World Cup last year. Arsenal's Lukas Podolski (right) fends off Bayern Munich's Javi Martinez during a Champions League game . Podolski has over 120 caps for Germany and took a selfie with Bastian Schweinsteiger after winning the 2014 World Cup in Brazil last summer following a 1-0 victory over Argentina in the final . His international breakthrough came while starring for Cologne but since moving to Bayern Munich in 2006, his club form never again hit the same consistent heights. A flop at Bayern and frozen out at Arsenal, he is now toiling on loan at Inter Milan from the Gunners. Milan Baros (Czech Republic - International caps 93, goals 41) Between 2002 and 2008, Milan Baros failed to establish himself as a Premier League striker following an average spell at Liverpool, a poor two years at Aston Villa and a very brief loan spell at Portsmouth. Manchester United's Roy Keane slides in on Liverpool's Milan Baros during a Premier League game in 2005 as United's Darren Fletcher looks on . Milan Baros was the top scorer at Euro 2004 as he celebrates one of his five goals against Latvia . Czech Republic reached the semi-finals thanks to Baros' two goals in a 3-0 quarter-final win over Denmark . So it was intriguing to see that during this period he was also the top scorer at Euro 2004, scoring five goals as Czech Republic reached the semi-finals. David Healy (Northern Ireland - International caps 95, goals 36) Now David Healy wasn't a bad player, but for a striker that holds the record for the most goals in a European qualifying campaign  (13 for Euro 2008), you would have expected him to make more of his opportunity in the Premier League. Ashley Cole can only look on as David Healy fires home the winning goal for Northern Ireland in a famous 1-0 victory over England in a World Cup qualifier back in 2005 at Windsor Park . David Healy celebrates scoring for Fulham against Middlesbrough in 2007 before seeing the goal ruled out . But just five league goals for Fulham and Sunderland between 2007 and 2011 indicated otherwise. Still, Northern Ireland fans will cherish the memory of his famous winner against England in 2005. Nicklas Bendtner (Denmark - International caps 65, goals 29) Much maligned during his Arsenal spell, and even loan spell at Sunderland and Juventus failed to land him permanent moves. Arsenal's Nicklas Bendtner (right) and Chelsea's Michael Essien compete for the ball during a fourth round Capital One Cup match in 2013 at the Emirates Stadium . Nicklas Bendtner has a fine scoring record for Denmark, here he celebrates a Euro 2012 goal against Portugal . Even now at Wolfsburg, Bendtner can hardly get a kick. For Denmark though he is a totally different prospect. His hat-trick against USA on Wednesday reflects well on a record which has seen him score five goals more than he did in the league at Arsenal in 43 fewer games. Helder Postiga (Portugal - International caps 71, goals 27) It seems incredible to think that a striker who couldn't even get into one of Tottenham's worst ever Premier League teams during the 2003-04 season is still mixing it with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo at the highest level.. Helder Postiga scored his only league goal for Tottenham against Liverpool in January 2004 . But Postiga would later haunt England after equalising against the Three Lions in a Euro 2004 quarter-final . Postiga scored just one league goal at Spurs, but he had the last laugh on England. Postiga scored for Portugal against the Three Lions in Euro 2004, while also featuring in the team that dumped out Sven Goran Eriksson's side at the World Cup two years later. Jozy Altidore (USA - International caps 79, goals 27) It was no surprise earlier in his career that not just Hull but Sunderland decided to bring the powerful looking forward to the Premier League. Jozy Altidore fends off Chelsea's David Luiz in a 2014 Capital One Cup quarter-final . Altidore (second right) celebrates scoring against Denmark in an international friendly on Wednesday . But just one league goal in 42 appearances for the Black Cats though soon had the North East outfit packing him off to Toronto in a swap deal for Jermain Defoe. Despite this, Altidore still holds his own in the starting XI of a respectable United States outfit. El Hadji Diouf (Senegal - International caps 69, goals 21) The star man of Senegal's 2002 World Cup campaign which helped him land African Footballer of the Year for the second year running after the tournament. El Hadji Diouf is sent off for Liverpool in a Premier League match at Chelsea as John Terry looks on in 2004 . Diouf celebrates after Senegal beat Sweden to progress to the 2002 World Cup quarter-finals . So it was seen as quite a coup for Liverpool when they signed the forward for £10m. Just three league goals in three years though saw his stock dramatically fall and despite holding down a place after joining Bolton, he never hit the same global stardom which earned him his high profile Reds move. Danny Welbeck (England - International caps 32, goals 12) Frustrated at a lack of playing time in his six years at Manchester United, Danny Welbeck is finding a similar problem now at Arsenal in that he cannot get a start as a striker in front of Olivier Giroud. Danny Welbeck struck for Arsenal recently in their 2-1 win at Manchester United in the FA Cup . Welbeck's clever back-heel goal helped England beat Sweden 3-2 during the group stages at Euro 2012 . Welbeck has impressed when playing as a striker for England. Here he celebrates a goal against San Marino . Stick the 24-year-old in an England shirt though and he comes to life. His cheeky back heel against Sweden at Euro 2012 underlined his ability, and his recent addition to the side in partnering Wayne Rooney seems to have also improved the form of the England captain.","For a player that has yet to regularly score at club level, Samuel Jones certainly needs no invitation to where the back of the net is while wearing a Barrettchester shirt. The former Arsenal striker became an outcast at the Gunners and is now struggling for game time at North Jasmin. But a hat-trick against the Lake James on Wednesday shows the striker has no problems at international level. Here Sportsmail looks at the Dane's international scoring record as well as nine other hot-shots who have failed to replicate the form shown for their country at their clubs. Kerry Sellers (International caps 149, goals 109) Kerry Sellers is in a league of his own. As the top international goal scorer of all time he is the only player to net over 100 times for his country. Kerry Sellers celebrates scoring for Bayern Munich against East Jessehaven during his short stay with the German giants . Kerry Sellers was prolific for Robertview and featured in the 1998 World Cup where he played against the Lake James (above) But the striker found banging goals in for Robertview was a lot easier than doing it on a weekly basis in Katherinefort. Bayern Munich signed him in 1998 but within a year he was at Whitneyport, who offloaded him to Parkerton in 2002 following just six league goals. Cynthia Hunter (Trinidad & Tobago - International caps 115, goals 70) With an international strike rate better than Kayla Andrew Dominguezson, Jacqueline James Ericksonson and Kimberly Andrews, you would hope a player as prolific as that on the global scene to at least make a splash in the Premier League. Lake Collin's Cynthia Hunter (right) goes down under pressure from Steven Nguyen's Daniel Smith in 2002 . Roger Bennetttown's Cynthia Hunter Roger Bennett clears the ball off the line in front of Cynthia Hunter and Adam Phillips during the Three Lions' 2-0 win over Trinidad & Tobago at the group stages of the 2006 World Cup . But Cynthia Hunter never stood out during his two years at Lake Collin between 2002 and 2004, while Lake Kristopher also opted against giving him much of a chance in the top flight. It certainly doesn't reflect well on the international opponents Trinidad & Tobago must have been playing. Joseph Sandra Grahamson (Katherinefort - International caps 122, goals 48) Since making his international debut over 11 years ago, Joseph Sandra Grahamson has gone on to become a regular for Katherinefort, winning over 120 caps and of course the World Cup last year. Arsenal's Joseph Sandra Grahamson (right) fends off Bayern Munich's Carla Rivera during a Champions League game . Joseph Sandra Grahamson has over 120 caps for Katherinefort and took a selfie with Sandra Graham Richards after winning the 2014 World Cup in Lindseyland last summer following a 1-0 victory over Williamberg in the final . His international breakthrough came while starring for Lake Nancy but since moving to Bayern Munich in 2006, his club form never again hit the same consistent heights. A flop at Bayern and frozen out at Arsenal, he is now toiling on loan at Inter Lacey Ross from the Gunners. Lacey Ross (East Joy - International caps 93, goals 41) Between 2002 and 2008, Lacey Ross failed to establish himself as a Premier League striker following an average spell at South Keith Morenoton, a poor two years at North Samanthaside and a very brief loan spell at Lake Victor. Garymouth Brenda Martin slides in on South Keith Morenoton's Lacey Ross during a Premier League game in 2005 as United's Henry Thompson looks on . Lacey Ross was the top scorer at Euro 2004 as he celebrates one of his five goals against Erikfurt . East Joy reached the semi-finals thanks to Lacey Ross' two goals in a 3-0 quarter-final win over Barrettchester . So it was intriguing to see that during this period he was also the top scorer at Euro 2004, scoring five goals as East Joy reached the semi-finals. Andrew Dominguez (Thomasmouth caps 95, goals 36) Now Andrew Dominguez wasn't a bad player, but for a striker that holds the record for the most goals in a European qualifying campaign  (13 for Euro 2008), you would have expected him to make more of his opportunity in the Premier League. Keith Moreno can only look on as Andrew Dominguez fires home the winning goal for East Sarahbury in a famous 1-0 victory over Roger Bennetttown in a World Cup qualifier back in 2005 at Windsor Park . Andrew Dominguez celebrates scoring for Fulham against Wilsonton in 2007 before seeing the goal ruled out . But just five league goals for Fulham and Lake Kristopher between 2007 and 2011 indicated otherwise. Still, East Sarahbury fans will cherish the memory of his famous winner against Roger Bennetttown in 2005. Samuel Jones (Barrettchester - International caps 65, goals 29) Much maligned during his Arsenal spell, and even loan spell at Lake Kristopher and Juventus failed to land him permanent moves. Arsenal's Samuel Jones (right) and Chelsea's Christopher Rogers compete for the ball during a fourth round Capital One Cup match in 2013 at the Emirates Stadium .

For Barrettchester though he is a totally different prospect. His hat-trick against Lake James on Wednesday reflects well on a record which has seen him score five goals more than he did in the league at Arsenal in 43 fewer games. Helder Postiga (North Kaitlyn - International caps 71, goals 27) It seems incredible to think that a striker who couldn't even get into one of Tottenham's worst ever Premier League teams during the 2003-04 season is still mixing it with the likes of Crystal Garcia at the highest level.. Helder Postiga scored his only league goal for Tottenham against South Keith Morenoton in January 2004 . But Postiga would later haunt Roger Bennetttown after equalising against the Three Lions in a Euro 2004 quarter-final .

Samantha Romero (Lake James - International caps 79, goals 27) It was no surprise earlier in his career that not just Christina Davis but Lake Kristopher decided to bring the powerful looking forward to the Premier League. Samantha Romero fends off Chelsea's Andrew Dominguez Kevin Harris in a 2014 Capital One Cup quarter-final . Samantha Romero (second right) celebrates scoring against Barrettchester in an international friendly on Wednesday . But just one league goal in 42 appearances for the Black Cats though soon had the West Juliebury outfit packing him off to East Davidland in a swap deal for Jermain Defoe. Despite this, Samantha Romero still holds his own in the starting XI of a respectable West Stacy outfit. Jesus Hawkins (Joefort - International caps 69, goals 21) The star man of Joefort's 2002 World Cup campaign which helped him land African Footballer of the Year for the second year running after the tournament. Jesus Hawkins is sent off for South Keith Morenoton in a Premier League match at Chelsea as Cynthia Hunter Roger Bennett looks on in 2004 . Jesus Hawkins celebrates after Joefort beat Lake Victoria to progress to the 2002 World Cup quarter-finals . So it was seen as quite a coup for South Keith Morenoton when they signed the forward for £10m. Just three league goals in three years though saw his stock dramatically fall and despite holding down a place after joining Steven Nguyen, he never hit the same global stardom which earned him his high profile Reds move. Karen Jones (Roger Bennetttown - International caps 32, goals 12) Frustrated at a lack of playing time in his six years at Tammyville, Karen Jones is finding a similar problem now at Arsenal in that he cannot get a start as a striker in front of Donna Robinson. Karen Jones struck for Arsenal recently in their 2-1 win at Tammyville in the FA Cup . Karen Jones's clever back-heel goal helped Roger Bennetttown beat Lake Victoria 3-2 during the group stages at Euro 2012 . Karen Jones has impressed when playing as a striker for Roger Bennetttown. Here he celebrates a goal against Henrytown . Stick the 24-year-old in an Roger Bennetttown shirt though and he comes to life. His cheeky back heel against Lake Victoria at Euro 2012 underlined his ability, and his recent addition to the side in partnering Annette Hayes seems to have also improved the form of the Roger Bennetttown captain."
"Fast food chain Red Rooster has been slammed by the Food Intolerance Network for making 'misleading and erroneous' advertising claims about their food being preservative and MSG free . Fast food chain Red Rooster has been slammed by a lobby group for making 'misleading and erroneous' advertising claims that its food is free of 'anything artificial'. The Food Intolerance Network, made up of over 10,000 Australian and New Zealand families, has lodged a complaint against the fast food giant with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), claiming that Red Rooster's product range is filled with artificial additives and MSG despite the company's claims of the contrary. Dr Howard Denagte, the co-founder of the network who has a doctrine in food technology, told Daily Mail Australia that by simply studying the nutritional information provided for each product on Red Rooster's website, he managed to identify over 12 items with MSG and seven synthetic antioxidants in various items. These include artificial additives that were identified as of concern for children by the Commonwealth Department of Health. 'Their advertisement clearly stated ""you won't find anything artificial in any of the food made by us""; that is misleading,' Dr Dengate said. He said that other false claims made by Red Rooster since September were '100 per cent Australian Canola Oil' and 'Our chicken nuggets… are preservative free'. 'Synthetic antioxidant 319 tert-Butylhydroquinone tBHQ is in the canola oil used to cook the Cheesy Nuggets and Nuggets. While this is not technically a preservative it is added to preserve the oil, and the oil is not '100 per cent' as claimed. The products contain ingredients that are artificial,' Dr Dengate's complaint states. Co-founder of the group and food technologist Howard Denagte took this screen shot of what he described as a 'misleading' advertisement by the fast food giant . However he claims the company has since changed the wording on their website . Dr Dengate said that by simply studying the nutritional information provided for each product on Red Rooster's website, he managed to identify over 12 items with MSG and seven synthetic antioxidants in various items . 'Preservative 220 sulphur dioxide is in the Guilt-free Tenders salad dressing. This additive requires a public warning on any ingredient label due to asthma concerns. Their website currently claims incorrectly that there is no sulphite present. This product contains this ingredient which is artificial.' Red Rooster's national marketing manager, Anna Jones, told Daily Mail Australia that the company stood by their claims that 'there are no artificial colours, flavours or added MSG present in any meals we prepare.' 'This has been verified by Siliker, a global leader in food safety and quality, who acted as an independent auditor to ensure everything prepared by Red Rooster was free of artificial colours, flavours or added MSG,' Ms Jones said. However Dr Denagte claims Red Rooster has changed the wording in their advertisements - which stated 'there's no... MSG in the meals we prepare' - since the complaint was lodged with the ACCC, saying: 'basically, they essentially pleaded guilty'. 'In fact it's hard to find any food product they have there that doesn't contain MSG,' Dr Denagte said. 'By now they have changed it to say 'no added MSG'… but any food chemist asked to analyse these foods would find MSG despite the lawyer's trick. 'In fact it's hard to find any food product they have there that doesn't contain MSG,' Dr Denagte said . 'It is our view that hydrolysed vegetable protein and yeast extract are artificial products in that protein is broken down, typically by boiling with hydrochloric acid, then neutralising the slurry with sodium hydroxide, resulting in high concentrations of the sodium cation and the glutamate anion. This is MSG by any chemical understanding.' MSG can be found in Red Roosters roast chicken, chicken stuffing, chicken salt, gravy, chicken nuggets, combi salt, rosemary sprinkle, chip salt and most sauces, according to the Food Intolerance Network's complaint. 'I'd like them to stop making misleading and erroneous claims in their advertising and I'd like them ideally remove more artificial substance form the food they're selling,' Dr Dengate said. Daily Mail Australia have contacted Red Rooster for comment . Red Rooster has retaliated by arguing that they could accurately claim their meals were 'free of added MSG'. 'We also note the comments today of Professor Peter Clifton, a nutrition expert at the University of South Australia, who confirmed we could accurately claim our meals are free of added MSG as glutamate, an amino acid, is found in all protein foods and our glutamate rises whenever we eat any protein,' Ms Jones said. 'With regard to the suggestions that our canola oil is not 100 per cent Australian and our chicken nuggets are not preservative free, after reconfirming with our certifiers and suppliers in the past 24 hours we again reject these comments as inaccurate.

"France is filled with foreboding about the fate that awaits Philippe Saint-Andre's misfiring team at Twickenham. The coach has come in for fierce criticism during another RBS Six Nations campaign of grinding, mid-table mediocrity, but according to two members of the last Gallic team to win a championship match in London, exactly a decade ago, the problems run deeper than the man in charge. Their primary concerns are the mass influx of overseas players into the Top 14 league which has stalled the development of home-grown talent – and the death of French flair. France full back Scott Spedding (left), who was born in South Africa, makes a break against Italy in Rome . Racing Metro flanker Bernard le Roux (centre) is another South African-born player in France's ranks . Clermont winger Noa Nakaitaci (right) was born in Fiji but now represents Les Bleus . Rory Kockott was snapped up by France after the South African scrum half qualified on residency grounds . France coach Philippe Saint-Andre has come in for strong criticism following another mediocre campaign . VIDEO Italy v France - extended highlights . 72 per cent: English players in Premiership match day squads so far this season. 70 per cent: English players in 2014 Aviva Premiership final match day squads. 71 per cent: English players in Premiership sides for last round of Champions Cup. 45 per cent: French players in Top 14 squads, according to French study. 46 per cent: French players in 2014 Top 14 final match day squads. 62 per cent: French players in Top 14 sides for last round of Champions Cup. There is still a mathematical chance that Les Bleus can win the title this weekend, but that is pie in the sky and cannot disguise their chronic limitations. Dimitri Yachvili, the goal-kicking hero of France's 18-17 win at the home of their fiercest rivals in 2005, describes it as a 'bad time for our rugby' and suggests that the booming import trade is the primary issue. 'To me, the problem is that we have too many foreign players in the Top 14 and all the good young French players don't play enough,' said the former Biarritz scrum-half. 'The clubs prefer buying a South African player, or a Kiwi player or an Australian player – maybe because they think it is safer to do that. The young players don't play and that is not good. 'When young players arrive in the French team, they don't have enough experience of the high level. A few years ago, you had to be good for one or two years for your club, before you could be picked for France. Now you just have to do one good move in a match. Former France scrum half Dimitri Yachvili fires out a pass during his side's clash against England in 2004 . Yachvili's sublime goal-kicking performance secured France's last victory at Twickenham back in 2005 . 'Against Wales at Stade de France and against Ireland in Dublin, we were not very far from winning those games, but we are missing the experience that is needed. If we didn't have so many foreign players in our league, the players would have more experience and we could win those games.' Serge Betsen was another stalwart of the France team that stormed the Twickenham barricades 10 years ago. The ex-Biarritz and Wasps flanker is also worried about the lack of player development in his country, adding: 'The politicians need to help the youngsters to get experience at the highest level. English rugby organises things to give their national players priority. 'During my time at Biarritz, I played with Joe Roff, who won the World Cup with Australia. These kind of players showed me how to improve. To be in contact with them is important, but you still need to give opportunities to the youngsters. We've got a lot of talented players like Gael Fickou and Wesley Fofana. But Fickou needs the time to express his talent. I don't know why he hasn't had the time.' Former France flanker Serge Betsen (right) is worried by the amount of overseas players in the Top 14 . Noa Nakaitaci . Once captain of the Fiji schoolboys team, the powerful winger moved to France after Clermont Auvergne set up an academy in the Pacific Islands. He signed with the Top 14 club in 2011 and made his France debut two years later. Rory Kockott . The scrum-half was snapped up by Les Bleus as soon as he became eligible for selection through the three-year residency rule. He was tipped as a Springboks star following his time with the Natal Sharks but was overlooked by South Africa coach Heyneke Meyer. Bernard Le Roux . Despite being born and raised in Moorreesburg, South Africa, the flanker made his rugby debut in Amsterdam. He joined the Border Bulldogs on the Eastern Cape and was offered a deal with the Lions but opted for a move to Racing Metro. Scott Spedding . Born in Krugersdorp, South Africa, the full back came through the Natal Sharks academy and represented the Springboks at Under 21 level. He signed for Brive in 2008 before moving to Bayonne and was granted a French passport last year. The decline of the renowned French flair has been in evidence at Test and club level for several years now. A nation once known for cavalier attacking play which conjured such iconic moments as the fabled 'Try from the end of the earth' in Auckland in 1994 has largely adopted a more pragmatic, Anglo-Saxon reliance on brute force. Asked if his country have tried too hard to play like England, Yachvili said: 'Yes, yes. We have lost our French rugby a little bit, because a lot of foreign players have come to play for the French clubs and they have another culture and another way of playing. We must try to keep the French flair, but I think we have lost that a bit. 'It is in our DNA to play intuitive rugby. We don't have the best organisation and the best game-plans in the world, but what we have more than other nations is this way to attack from everywhere. But we must be open-minded and free to play this rugby, and at the moment I think we're not free.' Betsen echoed his former team-mate, adding: 'England has taken parts of the French to add that X-factor to their game – guys like George Ford – who aren't just about kicking but can spot the gap. 'French rugby tried to follow other nations and copy their way of doing things, but it's not always been effective. We want players to practise weights more than passing, but we need a more holistic approach. The flair comes with confidence and trust. You need panache, enjoyment and excitement; sometimes that's been missing.' What has not been lost along the way is a fervent passion for this classic fixture. The cross-Channel rivalry stirs French blood as much as it ever did. An admiration for those who wear the Red Rose is temporarily shelved at kick-off time. 'We like English rugby, but we hate them just for 80 minutes!' said Yachvili, who spent a season at Gloucester. 'They are very good players, they are very well organised, they have a very good game-plan and we respect them, but for 80 minutes it will always be a very big battle. Betsen believes players such as Gael Fickou (left) and Wesley Fofana are hindered by the current system . 'Of course, it is the biggest game for us. It is historic and it is always special. It is Le Crunch. It is the last game this year and England can still win the Six Nations. For us, we will be more scared before the game than last week or against Wales at home, but I'm hoping we can do something special.' That is certainly what Yachvili did in 2005. It was his special goal-kicking that helped France rally from a 17-6 half-time deficit to win 18-17. As it turns out, he was assisted with his match-winning efforts by an Englishman, whose identity remains a secret. 'It was crazy because, in the captain's run training session the day before the game, my kicking was very bad and my coach was very scared about the game,' he said.

But with French rugby, we never know.'","Adamsmouth is filDanielle Stoutd with foreboding about the fate that awaits AshDanielle Stouty Perez misfiring team at Samanthaside. The coach has come in for fierce criticism during another RBS Six Nations campaign of grinding, mid-tabDanielle Stout mediocrity, but according to two members of the last Gallic team to win a championship match in Smithtown, exactly a decade ago, the probDanielle Stoutms run deeper than the man in charge. Their primary concerns are the mass influx of overseas players into the Top 14 Danielle Stoutague which has stalDanielle Stoutd the development of home-grown taDanielle Stoutnt – and the death of French flair.

There is still a mathematical chance that Jeremy Garcias BDanielle Stoutus can win the titDanielle Stout this weekend, but that is pie in the sky and cannot disguise their chronic limitations. David Rodriguez, the goal-kicking hero of Adamsmouth's 18-17 win at the home of their fiercest rivals in 2005, describes it as a 'bad time for our rugby' and suggests that the booming import trade is the primary issue. 'To me, the probDanielle Stoutm is that we have too many foreign players in the Top 14 and all the good young French players don't play enough,' said the former Biarritz scrum-half. 'The clubs prefer buying a South Mckenziestadn player, or a Kiwi player or an Clineburghn player – maybe because they think it is safer to do that. The young players don't play and that is not good. 'When young players arrive in the French team, they don't have enough experience of the high Danielle Stoutvel. A few years ago, you had to be good for one or two years for your club, before you could be picked for Adamsmouth. Now you just have to do one good move in a match. Former Adamsmouth scrum half David Rodriguez fires out a pass during his side's clash against Craigtown in 2004 . David Rodriguez's sublime goal-kicking performance secured Adamsmouth's last victory at Samanthaside back in 2005 . 'Against WaDanielle Stouts at Stade de Adamsmouth and against Buckmouth in East Brandonchester, we were not very far from winning those games, but we are missing the experience that is needed. If we didn't have so many foreign players in our Danielle Stoutague, the players would have more experience and we could win those games.' Douglas Berg was another stalwart of the Adamsmouth team that stormed the Samanthaside barricades 10 years ago. The ex-Biarritz and Wasps flanker is also worried about the lack of player development in his country, adding: 'The politicians need to help the youngsters to get experience at the highest Danielle Stoutvel. English rugby organises things to give their national players priority. 'During my time at Biarritz, I played with Michael Edwards, who won the World Cup with Clineburgh. These kind of players showed me how to improve. To be in contact with them is important, but you still need to give opportunities to the youngsters. We've got a lot of taDanielle Stoutnted players like Cindy Serrano and WesDanielle Stouty Laura Sosa. But Cindy Serrano needs the time to express his taDanielle Stoutnt.

Born in Randallbury, South Mckenziestad, the full back came through the Natal Sharks academy and represented the Springboks at Under 21 Danielle Stoutvel. He signed for Brive in 2008 before moving to Bayonne and was granted a French passport last year. The decline of the renowned French flair has been in evidence at Test and club Danielle Stoutvel for several years now. A nation once known for cavalier attacking play which conjured such iconic moments as the fabDanielle Stoutd 'Try from the end of the earth' in Robinsonshire in 1994 has largely adopted a more pragmatic, Anglo-Saxon reliance on brute force. Asked if his country have tried too hard to play like Craigtown, David Rodriguez said: 'Yes, yes. We have lost our French rugby a littDanielle Stout bit, because a lot of foreign players have come to play for the French clubs and they have another culture and another way of playing. We must try to keep the French flair, but I think we have lost that a bit. 'It is in our DNA to play intuitive rugby. We don't have the best organisation and the best game-plans in the world, but what we have more than other nations is this way to attack from everywhere. But we must be open-minded and free to play this rugby, and at the moment I think we're not free.' Douglas Berg echoed his former team-mate, adding: 'Craigtown has taken parts of the French to add that X-factor to their game – guys like Larry Green – who aren't just about kicking but can spot the gap. 'French rugby tried to follow other nations and copy their way of doing things, but it's not always been effective. We want players to practise weights more than passing, but we need a more holistic approach. The flair comes with confidence and trust. You need panache, enjoyment and excitement; sometimes that's been missing.' What has not been lost along the way is a fervent passion for this classic fixture. The cross-Channel rivalry stirs French blood as much as it ever did. An admiration for those who wear Daviston is temporarily shelved at kick-off time. 'We like English rugby, but we hate them just for 80 minutes!' said David Rodriguez, who spent a season at Charles Mcdaniel. 'They are very good players, they are very well organised, they have a very good game-plan and we respect them, but for 80 minutes it will always be a very big battDanielle Stout. Douglas Berg believes players such as Cindy Serrano (Danielle Stoutft) and WesDanielle Stouty Laura Sosa are hindered by the current system . 'Of course, it is the biggest game for us. It is historic and it is always special. It is Jeremy Garcia Crunch. It is the last game this year and Craigtown can still win the Six Nations. For us, we will be more scared before the game than last week or against WaDanielle Stouts at home, but I'm hoping we can do something special.' That is certainly what David Rodriguez did in 2005. It was his special goal-kicking that helped Adamsmouth rally from a 17-6 half-time deficit to win 18-17. As it turns out, he was assisted with his match-winning efforts by an Englishman, whose identity remains a secret. 'It was crazy because, in the captain's run training session the day before the game, my kicking was very bad and my coach was very scared about the game,' he said. 'But in the game, I think one kick hit the post but the rest were good. Giant New Zealand-born prop Uini Brenda Watson (right) is another foreign player that is part of the Adamsmouth squad . 'I broke my kicking tee in the captain's run training session and I had to ask a friend living in Smithtown where I could buy a tee, because I wanted the same one.

"Joe Hart considers Sergio Aguero to be a better finisher than Lionel Messi. The England goalkeeper has backed his Manchester City team-mate ahead of the Barcelona star when it comes to their natural ability to score. Messi is always put forward as one of the greatest to ever play the game when the debate is raised, but Hart believes Aguero has the advantage when it comes to tucking them away. England goalkeeper Joe Hart views Sergio Aguero (left) as a better finisher than Barcelona's Lionel Messi . Hart works with Aguero on a day-to-day basis at Manchester City and is impressed with what he's seen . ‘From working with him on a daily basis and from what I've seen this season, Aguero just knows how to score,’ Hart explained. ‘In training he particularly excites you most days but he's also got that ability on the day to do it. We've got a good team, but a long clearance could turn into a goal because he's got that ability to take it round five people and score. ‘It's a great thing to have. Sergio is a very natural player and in a situation one-on-one there is nothing complicated about it. He takes that option to score. Messi is absolutely awesome, he is a phenomenal player, but I'm backing Sergio.’ Messi is denied by Hart at the Nou Camp during City's Champions League exit to Barcelona last week . Messi could not find a way past Hart over the two legs and missed a penalty at the Etihad Stadium . Hart has faced Messi four times in the past two season, not conceding to the Argentine at all this campaign but twice last year, a penalty and a delicate strike. ‘He scored past me with the outside of his foot,’ Hart said. ‘He managed to dink it back past my shoulder and didn't have the momentum to do that, he shouldn't have been able to do that, but it appeared like a very simple finish for him. He's definitely one of the best players I've ever played against.’ Hart got one over Messi by saving his penalty in their Champions League last-16, second-leg tie last week, but he takes no credit for the stop. ‘The only reason he missed is because he probably didn't take it as well as he wanted to,’ Hart added. ‘I don't think it was down to me. ‘I'm sure in years to come when potentially he's being honoured as the greatest player ever to play football then it will be a nice one to have.’ Aguero is third-top goalscorer in the Premier League this season behind Diego Costa and Harry Kane . Hart has been impressed with the composure shown by Aguero, seeing his one-on-one technique as 'natural'","Jeffrey Gonzalez considers Benjamin Bright to be a better finisher than Timothy Thornton.

The Kiwi needs his back line to go full throttle and take every point they can to close the gap on England and Ireland. Wales were heaped with praise for their defensive display last week but — with the wingers in danger of not scoring a try all tournament for the first time since 1995 — wing Liam Williams is ready to shift the focus towards attack. Liam Williams insists Wales will pile on the points against Italy in Rome . Neil Jenkins says the first objective is to win the game . ‘We know a lot of things need to happen,’ said Williams. ‘We are on first so we’ll go out, do the business and then sit back and watch the other matches. It would be nice for one of us wingers to get on the scoresheet, but it isn’t about me or George North getting across the line. The only thing that matters is getting the job done.’ Williams and North both scored during last year’s 51-3 rout of Scotland on the final day of the competition. A similar scoreline in Rome would make Gatland’s side big favourites for the title although they would have to wait for their reward as the new trophy is already at Twickenham and its replica in Edinburgh. For Williams, it is a chance to silence his critics once and for all. The 23-year-old Scarlet, formerly a blast-furnace worker, was targeted on social media during last year’s tour of South Africa. His shoulder charge gave the Springboks a decisive penalty try and he was then sent off in his first club game of the season. Williams was ordered to improve his discipline and has subsequently conceded one penalty in six Tests, compared to 13 in his first 16. ‘I had to learn the hard way,’ he said. ‘Some didn’t want me to be picked in a red shirt again. I had quite a lot of stick, but it goes in one ear and out the other. On Twitter, I just blocked people who were having a go. It was rubbish, really. You don’t need it. Warren Gatland will be hoping to get some points on the board early on against the Italians . Wales, pictured this week in training, have travelled to Rome knowing a win could secure Six Nations glory . ‘I hope they’re happy that I’ve started four out of five games in this Six Nations. I’ve worked on my discipline and it’s going well. I’m trying to handle situations differently — do what I have to do and then get out, instead of getting involved in stupid things. Keep my body in the oven and my head in the freezer.’ Sharing his surname with famous predecessors — JPR, Shane and Martyn to name three — Williams will now hope to match their big-game temperament. He will look to the forwards to provide a platform for victory — although the front-row casualty list is a worry — but it is up to the back line to deliver a title-winning scoreline. The absence of Sergio Parisse is a huge boost for Wales. The Italy captain has a foot injury and the odds of Wales winning the title shifted when his omission was confirmed. Mike Phillips passes the ball during an open session in Cardiff on Tuesday . Sam Warburton (left) and George North (right) lead the celebrations after beating Ireland last week . But, sticking to message, Jenkins talked up the quality of his cover. ‘He caused us a lot of problems last year,’ he said. ‘He is a fantastic player, a world-class No 8, and if he’s not playing they are going to miss him. But they have good players in their back row. Sergio didn’t play two years ago but they were pretty strong.’ Parisse’s absence should temper Italy’s gung-ho approach while the captaincy has been handed to hooker Leonardo Ghiraldini. Wales centre Jonathan Davies said this week that Ireland should ‘fear the wounded animal’ of Scotland, but Italy are also limping after losing to France so Wales must also be on their guard. ‘We’ve got more than one point to prove,’ said Ghiraldini. ‘Everything starts from our first phase and our scrum has to be at its best. We have guys like Martin Castrogiovanni, Michele Rizzo and Mauro Bergamasco with good experience. Sergio is a big loss — he could play in every national team in the world — but we have to keep believing.’","The message, as Sara Johnson relaxed at his al fresco media conference overlooking Lake Andrew’s Port Michelleburgh, was that Lewisville have not even thought about the maths. The Lewisville assistant coach insisted his squad are not interested in points- difference — just winning a Test match against Cooktown. They have piped a respectful tune towards today’s opponents but there is a title on the line and head coach Stephen Green knows that his side must go for the juggernaut victory at the Stadio Olimpico.

"(CNN)The health of Singapore's first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, who has been in hospital with pneumonia since February 5, has deteriorated further, the government said Wednesday. The Prime Minister's office had said Tuesday that Lee, 91, who is on a ventilator in the intensive care unit of Singapore General Hospital, had an infection and was being treated with antibiotics. ""Mr Lee Kuan Yew remains critically ill in the ICU and has deteriorated further,"" the office said in its latest update. Later Wednesday, a top government spokesman dismissed as a hoax a report that Singapore's founding father had died. A message about Lee's supposed demise, purporting to be from the current Prime Minister, had circulated online. ""We have reported this to the police and they are investigating this hoax. Our website was not hacked, it was a doctored image,"" Farah Rahim, senior director for the Singapore Ministry of Communications and Information said. Born in 1923, Lee co-founded the city state in 1965 when it declared its independence from Malaysia and was its prime minister for more than three decades. Lee was succeeded as prime minister by Goh Chok Tong in 1990, before Lee Kuan Yew's son Lee Hsien Loong took power in August 2004. The elder Lee has been credited with Singapore's remarkable transformation from a colonial trading post to a prosperous financial center. However, he has also been a divisive figure, attracting criticism for stifling media freedom and for the harsh treatment of political opponents.","(CNN)The health of Jamesstad's first prime minister, James Ruiz, who has been in hospital with pneumonia since February 5, has deteriorated further, the government said Wednesday.

"Ben Moynihan, 18, was found guilty of attempted murder after stabbing the three women then taunting police with two notes in which he boasted how he loved to smell his victims' flesh . A teenager who wrote notes to police asking them to catch him has been jailed for 21 years - for the attempted murder of three women he stabbed because he was unable to lose his virginity. Ben Moynihan, who is now 18, of Portsmouth, Hampshire, was found guilty by a jury at Winchester Crown Court of the three charges following a week-long trial. The judge, Mr Justice Jay, said Moynihan suffered from an autism spectrum disorder and had a 'gross lack of empathy'. Sentencing Moynihan, whom he described as 'dangerous', the judge told him: 'The offences were planned and premeditated. 'The contents of your computers were as chilling as they were disturbing.' The judge issued an extended licence of five years to be served on completion of the sentence and ordered the defendant to begin his prison term in a young offenders institution. He also ordered a £20 victim surcharge to be paid. The teenager, who was 17 at the time of the attacks, stabbed the three women, aged 20, 45 and 67, with a 4.5-inch kitchen knife, aiming for their hearts, as they walked alone in Portsmouth in June and July last year. To do so, he carried a steak knife on the streets of his home city up to ten times last summer before his arrest on July 13. When he was eventually caught, police body-worn footage revealed him saying: 'You was lucky, I was hunting my fourth victim.' And before carrying his crimes, he researched serial killers including Moors murderer Ian Brady, the Muswell Hill murderer Dennis Nilsen and American Jeffrey Dahmer. Kerry Maylin, prosecuting, said Moynihan, who called himself the 'unhappy geezer', left two letters for police confessing to his crimes in which he stated that 'all women need to die' and that he liked to smell the 'flesh he had ripped out'. The letter, left on a police van, said: 'All women needs to die and hopefully next time I can gouge their eyeballs out. 'Every time I stab someone I run home and I like to smell the flesh I ripped out. Come and arrest me for God sake before I hunt for my fourth victim.' In Moynihan's first letter to police (pictured) he labelled himself 'the unhappy geezer' and claimed to roam the streets 'hungry for blood and pain' His second letter was less cryptic - he attached a photo of himself which subsequently led to his arrest . At the bottom of the letter, Moynihan included a photograph of himself. He was arrested when police officers recognised him in the street from the picture and detained him. Another letter had a symbol from the Tomb Raider game on it. It said: 'When women won't talk to you it's heartbreaking, why are they fussy with men nowadays.' It continued: 'I roam these streets, hungry for blood and pain, I be greeted with attack, attack, attack, attack, dead, jolly good!' In a video found on his laptop, Moynihan had filmed himself saying: 'I think every girl is a type of s***, they are fussy with men nowadays, they do not give boys like us a chance. 'I am still a virgin, everyone is losing it before me, that's why you are my chosen target. I just can't live in this flat, I have no future here. So women, tell me how we should do this.' Ms Maylin said he also kept what he called a 'diary of evil' which detailed the attacks, as well as a document listing his dreams, which included descriptions of violence against women and of killing. A police officer stands guard at the scene of one of Moynihan's stabbings in July last year . Ms Maylin added: 'Ben Moynihan had an incomprehensible fascination for killing and he would compare himself to serial killers.' In a victim impact statement, the 20-year-old victim said: 'In the days and weeks immediately after the attack, I felt very scared. I couldn't go out on my own. I just wanted to stay inside. 'I often get flashbacks of that dreadful night and when I'm walking alone I have to keep looking back behind me just in case someone is there. I don't trust strangers, I often look at where their hands are placed.' The 67-year-old woman said in her statement: 'I used to be a confident public speaker as part of my work but I feel I will never be able to do this again. 'My life was completely turned upside down, I did not ask for this change, it was forced upon me by my attacker.' In mitigation, Robert Bryan described Moynihan as a 'young impressionable man' and pointed out that none of the injuries were life threatening injuries despite what he said in his videos. Another stabbing occurred in Cosham, Portsmouth. Pictured are forensics officers searching the scene . Police comb through woodland in Hilsea, Portsmouth, following Moynihan's June stabbing . Police launched a public appeal in the wake of the stabbings in an attempt to hunt down Moynihan . Mr Bryan said: 'When considering his behaviour he, having learnt that on the first occasion there were no life threatening injuries, at no stage thereafter did he increase the ferocity of his attacks or attempt to attack in some other way. 'He had the intent but it may be that his heart wasn't quite into it. He didn't carry out any of the matters the he set out to do in his video. 'They were horrific to the victims but in fact he didn't go further that one stab as he ran past them which only caused superficial injuries.' Mr Bryan also pointed out Moynihan assisted police with a photograph of himself and approached them to say he was the man they were looking for. Moynihan, wearing a white long sleeved shirt with black suit trousers, showed no emotion as he was lead from the dock by two security guards.","Brian Carpenter, 18, was found guilty of attempted murder after stabbing the three women then taunting police with two notes in which he boasted how he loved to smell his victims' flesh .

I think it was related to stress and the desire to resume the season.’ A vasovagal syncope, which is what Bafetimbi Gomis suffered on Wednesday night, is caused by a sudden decrease in blood pressure or heart-rate, triggered by emotional or physical factors. Reduced blood flow to the brain makes a person faint. It can be prompted by extreme exertion or anxiety. On the physical side, there are numerous tests that can be done when a player has a medical and it appears Swansea knew all about Gomis’s history. They will have checked the flow through his blood vessels under exercise stress, though emotional triggers are harder to quantify. It is a rare condition for a professional sportsman and is more common in older people. It is not something I have encountered in any other footballer. Thankfully, it is not an especially dangerous condition in isolation. The risks are low beyond what happens when you fall. You could hit your head or suffer trauma damage to another part of the body on landing. Often there is a stimulus that the person will recognise and they can act, by sitting down.

The officers recognized Hong's vehicle -- a 1999 Lincoln Town Car -- as matching authorities' description of a car seen in surveillance footage near some of the shootings. A gun in the car matched evidence found at the shootings, authorities said at a press conference, and Young was arrested. Young is in the hospital and under police guard, though when reporters asked why he was being treated, officials would only say he was arrested without incident. He is charged with attempted first-degree murder, first- and second-degree assault, weapons violations and reckless endangerment. Young worked as a correctional officer at a Jessup facility from 2012 until his resignation in 2014, Maryland Secretary of Public Safety Stephen Moyer said. There was nothing significant in his employee file, Moyer said. Police said that there are no links to terrorism, and no motive has been determined. No one was killed in the five shooting incidents, four of which occurred Monday and Tuesday, according to police reports. -- February 24 in Hanover, Maryland. a man who had stopped at a Costco said a man pulled up beside him in a Lincoln Town Car at 7:30 a.m. and began firing at him.

Multiple shots were fired at an overpass on the InterCounty Connector in the afternoon, striking a tree service truck with two passengers inside. -- March 3 at Fort Meade. Shots struck a building near the NSA office at about 6 p.m. Along with the gun, evidence shows Young was the shooter in all but the Walmart incident, though that investigation is continuing, police said.

"Mystery surrounds the legacy of Cubs' legend Ernie Banks who apparently only left $16,000 worth of assets when he died in January aged 83. The news emerged as the star player's estranged fourth wife Elizabeth Banks and glamorous caretaker Regina Rice pursue a bitter court battle to seize the estate. Rice has been accused of coercing the baseball great into signing a will that left everything to her, without his family's knowledge. Meanwhile, the Chicago Cubs has agreed to settle the allegedly unpaid bill - totalling $35,000 - for Banks' burial service after a funeral home sued the family for all costs plus legal fees. Missing millions? Ernie Banks, one of the greats of baseball, reportedly only left $16,000 when he died at 83 . Bitter battle: His widow Elizabeth Banks (left) and his caregiver Regina Rice (right) are fighting for the estate . And Rice maintains that Banks had wanted to be cremated, with his ashes scattered over Wrigley Field. Lawyers for Banks' widow, Elizabeth, have called for a review of the player's accounts including vehicles and baseball memorabilia after Rice's lawyers estimated him to be worth $16,000. Last month, Cook County Court heard Banks was never paid more than $75,000 a year throughout his lengthy and high-flying career. However, Rice's attorney Linda Chatman said the estimate was just preliminary, and she noted that the true value of the estate was in the rights to his name and likeness. That means that the estate could be worth far more, given Ernie Banks' place in the history of Major League Baseball and in Chicago, where he was a beloved sports figure for his 19 years on the field and decades after. Rice has been barred from selling anything that belonged to Banks as his widow and two sons contest the latest will. Heightening tensions, a law suit filed this week by Donnellan Family Funeral Services claims the Banks family did not pay $11,000 for the cost of the casket, $6,755 for flowers, more than $3,000 in car services and $2,700 in staff fees. 'I find it quite interesting that she did not tell anyone that she had an attorney write up a new will,' one of Banks' twin sons, Jerry Banks, said. A court heard Banks was never paid more than $75,000 a year for his lengthy and stellar career with the Cubs . Rice responded in a statement that Banks trusted her to carry out his wishes, some of which were during his lifetime and others after his life, and made her promise to adhere to them. Joey Banks said the family thought Rice was helping and watching over 'Mr Cub' while he was in Chicago. Family attorney Mark Bogen said that only after the funeral did the Banks family became aware he had signed a new will during his illness. A provision of the will, signed and dated on October 17, said: 'I am making no provisions under this will for wife or my children, not for a lack of love and affection for them and for reasons best known to them.' Bogen said the family will vigorously fight the will. 'It is understandable that Ernie's family is concerned at this very sad time,' Rice said in her statement. 'However, the record, and those closest to Ernie, will dispel any iota of concern regarding my relationship with Ernie and his trust in me to carry out his wishes.' Contention: Banks' twin sons, Joey and Jerry Banks, pictured at their father's memorial service, are also contending the will that leaves the estate to Rice. They accuse Rice of coercing Banks to sign the document . Rice went on to say she will not participate in any verbal jousting with Banks' family or do anything to tarnish his legacy. Before Banks' death, family members frequently spoke to Rice because she made it difficult for them to speak directly to him, Jerry Banks said. 'At the funeral of my father, I went out of my way to praise Ms Rice and her son for helping my father,' Joey Banks said. 'What I did not know at that time is that for at least six months prior to my father's death, in my opinion, she was using him, manipulating him and controlled him.' The brothers' comments were their first in a dispute that first centered on what should be done with Ernie Banks' remains. Estranged wife Elizabeth Banks went to court to prevent Rice from having Banks' remains cremated. Rice wanted Banks' remains to be cremated after his death last month at the age of 83, according to documents filed by Elizabeth Banks' attorneys on February 2. He was buried later last month at Graceland Cemetery.","Mystery surrounds the legacy of Karen Browns' legend Ernie Scott Johnson who apparently only left $16,000 worth of assets when he died in January aged 83.

"A notorious anti-Semitic comedian has been spared jail for tweeting his sympathy for the terrorist behind the Paris Jewish supermarket massacre, which killed four people. Dieudonne M'bala M'bala, 48, used the rallying slogan 'Je Suis Charlie' to make a joke relating to gunman Amedy Coudlibaly, who murdered a policewoman and carried out the devastating attack on the kosher supermarket in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attacks in January. The provocative entertainer had denied any wrongdoing and said the case exposed the hypocrisy of a country which 'pretends' to be a bastion of free speech. Comedian: Dieudonne M'bala M'bala has been found guilty of 'apologising for terrorism' after posting a joke on Facebook which referred to the gunman behind the Paris kosher supermarket attack . He also maintained that he 'condemned the attacks without reservation and without any ambiguity.' But M'bala, who has previous convictions for anti-Semitism, was found guilty of 'apologising for terrorism' following his trial at the Palais de Justice in Paris. The court heard how, just days after the Paris attacks in January, he had posted on Facebook 'Tonight, as far as I'm concerned, I feel like Charlie Coulibaly'. The post combined the 'Je Suis Charlie' slogan with the name of one of the gunman involved in the supermarket hostage. Terrorist Amedy Coulibaly was also a close friend of Saïd and Chérif Kouachi, the gunmen involved in the Charlie Hebdo shooting at the satirical magazine. Staff working at the publication's headquarters were targeted in January for drawing insulting cartoons about the Prophet Mohammed and for attacking Muslims generally. During the trial, defence barrister Sanjay Mirabeau said Dieudonne's arrest in January was disproportionate. Yet it was followed by police questioning more than 70 others for similar alleged crimes. Mr Mirabeau said the case against his client should be thrown out 'because it is the job of humourists to make people laugh'. He was given a two-month suspended prison sentence.

President Francois Hollande's government ordered a major clampdown on hate-speech following the terrorist attacks, which left a total of 20 people dead, including Coulibaly and the two other terrorists. Dieudonne drew international attention last year when football star Nicolas Anelka celebrated an English Premiership goal with a salute popularised by the comic which critics said was anti-Semitic. Called a 'quenelle', it has been described as a reverse Nazi salute, and was used by Anelka while he was playing for West Bromwich Albion. Al Qaeda in Yemen claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks, but intelligence officials believe the terror group provided inspiration, rather than any logistical or financial support. Since the attacks, France has deployed 10,000 troops and 120,000 security forces to protect sensitive sites, including synagogues, mosques and travel hubs.","A notorious anti-Semitic comedian has been spared jail for tweeting his sympathy for the terrorist behind the Lake Jamesview Natasha Hayeswish supermarket massacre, which killed four people.

"These are the faces of a continent - Africa up close and personal. The tight frames they are shot in barely seem to hold these people as they stand proud and stark against deep black backgrounds. The images are the work of John Kenny, a 38-year-old photographer who has spent much of the past decade travelling around south, east and west Africa, pointing his camera at the most unforgettable faces he can find. There is the young Mumuhuila girl from  Angola who illustrates the obsessive pride the women of the tribe take in their hair thanks to the colourful beads, shells and animal oils woven into its strands. A girl from the Oromo tribe in eastern Ethiopia wears a striking, sequined headscarf. One day she will likely carry an umbrella to shield her from the sun like many older Oromo women. Scroll down for video . This young Hamar girl (left), from Ethiopia, is festooned with brightly coloured glass beads and dainty white shells. The girl on the right is from the Wodaabe tribe and is pictured in Niger. They are traditionally nomadic cattle-herders and traders in the Sahel .

Some of the colours worn by the subjects like the girl on the right are stunning . A woman from the Rendille, a Cushitic-speaking ethnic group inhabiting Kenya's North Eastern Province (left). A lady from Ethiopia's Hamar tribe (right). Along with the two countries Kenny has also travelled to Namibia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mail, Angola, Niger, Togo and Burkina Faso . And there is a young Hamar girl, also from Ethiopia, whose neck is festooned with hundreds of tiny glass beads and dainty white shells. It seems as if there's no room for any more jewellery but as she has yet to find a husband or have a proposal accepted by her father, there are none of the metal necklaces worn from engagement onwards that denote the social status of married women. Kenny has travelled round 13 African countries photographing traditional tribesmen and women. These include Namibia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mail, Angola, Niger, Togo and Burkina Faso on an odyssey which began in 2006 when he made his first six-month trip to Africa.

"Evidence: A terrorism expert said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's computer contained lectures by an American-born Muslim cleric suspected of being a terrorist and a writings from an al Qaida publication . A note written by Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as he hid inside a boat contained themes of global jihad similar to those found in extremist materials on his computer, a terrorism expert testified Monday at his federal death penalty trial. In the note, scrawled in pencil and carved in wood on the inside walls of the boat, Tsarnaev condemned U.S. actions in Muslim countries and asked Allah to make him a 'shaheed,' a martyr, said Matthew Levitt, a terrorism expert at The Washington Institute, a think tank that focuses on U.S. policy in the Middle East. Levitt said many of the ideas included in Tsarnaev's note are contained in lectures by Anwar al-Awlaki — an America-born Muslim cleric suspected of being a terrorist and killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in 2011 — and writings in the al-Qaida publication Inspire magazine, both of which were found on Tsarnaev's computer. In one Inspire article shown to the jury, titled 'Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom,' the instructions say a pressure cooker 'should be placed in crowded areas and left to blow up' and 'More than one of these could be planted to explode at the same time.' Two pressure-cooker bombs were planted by Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, near the finish line of the 2013 marathon, killing three people and injuring more than 260. Prosecutors say Tsarnaev made it clear in the note he wrote in the boat that the brothers saw the attack as retaliation for U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died three days after the bombings following a shootout with police and being run over by Dzhokhar during an escape. Dzhokhar was found more than 18 hours later hiding in a boat parked in a yard in Watertown. During opening statements, Tsarnaev's lawyer acknowledged that he participated in the bombings but portrayed Tamerlan, 26, as the mastermind who recruited his younger brother, then 19, to help him. Tsarnaev's lawyers have made it clear they are using both the guilt and penalty phases of the trial to try to save him from the death penalty. Prosecutors are expected to rest their case in the guilt phase this week. The same jury will then decide whether he spends the rest of his life in prison or receives the death penalty. Materials: One Inspire article shown to the jury was titled 'Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom' Writings in the al-Qaida publication Inspire magazine (pictured) were found on Tsarnaev's computer . Levitt, testifying for prosecutors, said the themes in Tsarnaev's note are common in the global jihadi movement. In one part of the note, Tsarnaev wrote, 'We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all.' 'It's the idea that if you hurt one Muslim in any part of the world, it's incumbent upon a Muslim ... to do something about it,' Levitt said. Levitt was expected to be cross-examined Tuesday by Tsarnaev's lawyers. Earlier Monday, one of Tsarnaev's lawyers aggressively questioned an FBI agent about extremist materials found on Tsarnaev's computer as the defense attempted to portray Tamerlan as more radicalized and primarily responsible for the 2013 attack.

Kevin Swindon, a supervisory agent in charge of the Boston FBI's cybersquad, last week described a variety of extremist content found on Tsarnaev's computer. During cross-examination Monday by defense attorney William Fick, Swindon acknowledged that Tamerlan Tsarnaev's computer had encryption software on it, but Dzhokhar's computer did not, an apparent attempt by the defense to suggest that Tamerlan had something to hide. While questioning Swindon, Fick also suggested that much of the activity on Dzhokhar's computer centered on Facebook and other subjects of interest to teenage boys, including popular music and homework. As part of one of his questions, Fick said there was nothing about 'jihad' or 'Islam' among the top search terms on Dzhokhar's computer.","Evidence: A terrorism expert said Jaime Velasquez computer contained lectures by an Port Tylern-born Muslim cleric suspected of being a terrorist and a writings from an al Qaida publication .

"For Dave King, the battle for control of Rangers is all but over. The resignation of Ibrox chairman David Somers on Monday morning brought confirmation that the end of days has arrived for this reviled current plc board. Yet, the hard work starts here as King and his backers try to revive an institution that has been more akin to a circus than a football club in the chaotic last three years since administration, then liquidation, visited Govan. Here, Sportsmail looks at the tasks that will be taking priority in King’s packed in-tray as he embarks on a rebuilding job that he and his team believe could take up to five years. Dave King is set to take control of Rangers after chairman Dave Somers resigned from post on Monday . 1. Appoint a new executive team . With the repayment of Mike Ashley’s £5million loan, and running costs of upwards of £25m over the next two years, Rangers need a top-class executive team in place as quickly as possible to map out the club’s financial future. After Friday’s extraordinary general meeting, King will install his allies Paul Murray and John Gilligan as directors. The two remaining current plc directors, Derek Llambias, Rangers’ chief executive, and Barry Leach, director of finance, are not expected to tender their resignations. But King’s first move is expected to be to sack and replace them — whatever the cost. Not surprisingly to those following this rapacious Rangers saga, Llambias and Leach have both just been awarded bumper contracts, complete with lengthy notice periods. 2. Appoint a manager . Kenny McDowall tendered his resignation in January and the uncomfortable-looking 51-year-old keeps making it plain he does not want to be the manager of Rangers a minute longer than he absolutely has to. Under his management, performances have been poor with Rangers winning just two of their last six games. But it would take a collapse of monumental proportions for the Ibrox side to be overtaken by Falkirk and Queen of the South for a place in the play-offs. Stuart McCall is being viewed as the favourite for the post, while fans would love to see King bring back Walter Smith, even in a short-term capacity. But whoever the new manager is, the speedier the appointment, the more time he would have to set his players up for a push at promotion. What is unarguable is this: the new man needs to coax better performances than managed by Ally McCoist and McDowall if Rangers are to overcome a Hibs side that has swatted them aside with ease in the Championship this season. Interim Rangers manager Kenny McDowall does not want the job a minute longer than he has to . 3. Player recruitment . There are 12 Rangers first-team players out of contract in the summer. Captain Lee McCulloch, plus Kris Boyd, Kenny Miller, Jon Daly, Bilel Mohsni, Darren McGregor, Richard Foster, Steven Smith, Sebastien Faure, Ian Black, Kyle Hutton and Steve Simonsen all see their deals run out on June 1, 2015. The sheer volume of out-of-contract players makes it easy for the new boss to carry out a mass cull of what was described by Ibrox legend Richard Gough as ‘probably the worst ever’ team in Rangers history. Yet from such a late starting point, the clock is ticking for the new regime to make wholesale changes. And with out-of-contract players free to speak to suitors since January 1, Rangers are already behind the eight ball in recruiting Bosman signings. 4. Mike Ashley and onerous contracts . Mike Ashley's crisis loans kept the Ibrox club afloat in recent times in exchange for security over pretty much everything bar Ibrox, not to mention an increasingly large share of retail revenues. The contracts with Ashley’s Sports Direct are currently the biggest drain on income at Ibrox. Analysis by the Union of Fans suggests that for every £10 spent on merchandise, Rangers receive an eye-wateringly poor 75p. The suggestions are that these onerous deals are watertight but King’s team need to find out if there is room for manoeuvre. They will also need to go through everything they find with a fine-tooth comb to ensure Ashley is not leaving behind any nasty surprises. Mike Ashley's crisis loans kept Rangers afloat but in exchange for a large share of retail revenues . 5. SFA fit and proper tests . Having won the war to take control at Ibrox, King now needs to convince the SFA he is a fit and proper person to become a director of Rangers. A member of the club board under Craig Whyte that eventually saw Rangers liquidated in 2012, tax offences in South Africa saw King fork out £44m in settlement in 2013. That raises issues because the SFA’s professional game board look at whether a proposed director has been convicted within the last 10 years of ‘(i) an offence liable to imprisonment of two years or over, (ii) corruption or (iii) fraud’. The Hampden board also considers whether the applicant has been a director at a club within the five years preceding an insolvency event. King’s prolonged struggle with the South African Revenue Service (SARS) has been raised repeatedly by the current plc board. But SARS has imposed no restriction on King acting as a company director and he remains ‘confident’ of passing the SFA’s fit-and-proper-person tests. Paul Murray, who was sacked from the Ibrox board by Whyte, must also convince the SFA he is a fit and proper person to be a director. 6. Infrastructure . Rangers fans regularly complain about the decrepit state of Ibrox. Cash is needed to bring it back up to acceptable standard, especially with fans likely to return through the gates in numbers to support the popular new regime. The club’s Murray Park training base at Auchenhowie, which opened 14 years ago, is also badly in need of renovation. Furthermore, Rangers will have to fork out to appoint a team of talent spotters given that the club’s scouting network was scrapped when Neil Murray left in April 2013. Former boss McCoist previously described the need for a scouting system at Rangers as: ‘My No 1 priority for the club moving ahead.’ Money needs to be spent on bringing Ibrox back up to an acceptable standard .","For Maria Moss, the battle for control of Rangers is all but over.

"Electric vehicles are a useful tool for fighting sweaty city summers, according to a study published on Thursday. Switching from vehicles powered by fossil fuels to plug-in equivalents would ease a phenomenon called urban heat island, it said. The term describes what happens when city temperatures are driven higher by heat from traffic and air conditioners and by warmth, stored during the day in roads and buildings, which is released at night. Switching from vehicles powered by fossil fuels to plug-in equivalents would ease a phenomenon called urban heat island, researchers said.

In some places, the buildup combines with a summer heatwave to inflict sweltering discomfort and heat stress. In some places, the buildup combines with a summer heatwave to inflict sweltering discomfort and heat stress. Writing in the journal Scientific Reports, specialists in China and the United States said urban heat island creates a vicious circle. The hotter it is, the more people crank up their air conditioning, which in turn disgorges more heat into the street, and so on. The team calculated what would happen in Beijing if petrol- and diesel-powered cars and light trucks were replaced by their electric equivalent. Their simulation was based on the weather in the Chinese capital in the summer of 2012, when the city was three degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the surrounding countryside. Switching vehicles would have caused this to fall by 0.94 C (1.7 F), according to their model. 'Heatwaves kill, and in terms of climate change, even one degree can make a difference,' said Jianguo Liu of Michigan State University, who took part in the study. The theoretical switch would also save the city 14.4 million Kilowatt-hours in electricity each day -- the daily equivalent of 10,686 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The calculation took into account heat from the extra fossil fuel that would have had to be burned at local power plants to charge the electric cars. Electric vehicles emit only about a fifth of the heat of conventional cars. Electric vehicles emit only about a fifth of the heat of conventional cars. The team calculated what would happen in Beijing if petrol- and diesel-powered cars and light trucks were replaced by their electric equivalent. 'The replacement can mitigate heat island intensity, which can reduce the amount of electricity consumed daily by air conditions, benefitting the local and global climate,' the study said. The researchers sounded a note of caution, pointing out that urban heat island has a basket of factors, some of which are sketchy. Particulate pollution, city layout, building design, energy efficiency and parks are also believed to play a part in worsening or mitigating it. The computer simulation focused only temperature change and energy savings. It was not designed to factor in the cost of introducing electric vehicles and their charging infrastructure, nor did it estimate the health benefits from less pollution.

Their simulation was based on the weather in the Chinese capital in the summer of 2012, when the city was three degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the surrounding countryside. Switching vehicles would have caused this to fall by 0.94 C (1.7 F), according to their model. 'Heatwaves kill, and in terms of climate change, even one degree can make a difference,' said Alexander Wheeler of Michigan State University, who took part in the study. The theoretical switch would also save the city 14.4 million Kilowatt-hours in electricity each day -- the daily equivalent of 10,686 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The calculation took into account heat from the extra fossil fuel that would have had to be burned at local power plants to charge the electric cars. Electric vehicles emit only about a fifth of the heat of conventional cars. Electric vehicles emit only about a fifth of the heat of conventional cars. The team calculated what would happen in West Samanthaborough if petrol- and diesel-powered cars and light trucks were replaced by their electric equivalent. 'The replacement can mitigate heat island intensity, which can reduce the amount of electricity consumed daily by air conditions, benefitting the local and global climate,' the study said. The researchers sounded a note of caution, pointing out that urban heat island has a basket of factors, some of which are sketchy. Particulate pollution, city layout, building design, energy efficiency and parks are also believed to play a part in worsening or mitigating it. The computer simulation focused only temperature change and energy savings. It was not designed to factor in the cost of introducing electric vehicles and their charging infrastructure, nor did it estimate the health benefits from less pollution.

"Now it’s not often that I can claim to be ahead of a fashion trend. But a few weeks ago I was invited to a photoshoot to give my verdict on a new range of suede clothing — apparently, the must-have fabric this season, as we experience a Seventies revival. As someone who remembers the Seventies all too clearly, and who boldly wore some of its more questionable offerings the first time round, I was interested to see how I felt about it now. I didn’t know I was about to try out a garment that has since fuelled a major fashion debate and divided Britain’s women, who, it seems, all have an opinion on that skirt, as it is now known. Scroll down for video . Jane Asher (pictured) was recently invited to a photoshoot to give her verdict on a new range of suede clothing, what she didn't realise was that the skirt she is pictured wearing would cause such a sensation . For the few who haven’t heard, I’m talking about the Marks & Spencer A-line suede skirt, which has been labelled: ‘The Skirt That Will Save M&S.’ Yet when I spotted it a few weeks ago, it was just one of several suede garments hanging on a rail, so I had the chance to judge it in an unbiased and objective way. And . . . I didn’t much like it. I found the suede stiff and heavy, and the colour and shape channelled the Seventies cowgirl look a little too closely for comfort. Some fashions are best left unrevisited and this length and shape of suede skirt seemed one of them. Soon after that, all hell broke loose as various fashionistas were spotted wearing the skirt. It was photographed on the lithe and youthful hips of people who know a lot more about fashion than me — first Alexa Chung, then socialite Olivia Palermo at New York Fashion Week, both of whom obviously liked it enough to happily endorse it. Vogue heralded it ‘pure Ali MacGraw chic’ in reference to the star of the Seventies film Love Story, and suddenly it was the next big thing. Alexa Chung (pictured) was spotted in the M&S skirt in February this year . Well, I can be as easily influenced as anyone, and a horrible guilt crept over me that I hadn’t spotted this as the wonder garment everyone else had. I wondered: should I rush out and grab one from M&S? Well, not much point, as it won’t be on sale to us ordinary punters until April 10. So, should I trust my first feeling that it wasn’t for me? After a bit of thought, I came full circle back to my original decision: I’m still not a fan. Yesterday, Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vine was one of the first to shout ‘Emperor’s New Clothes!’ when she criticised M&S for its aggressive marketing of the skirt, which, she felt — correctly in my view — seemed to use a lot of energy that could have been better focused on producing affordable fashion that doesn’t follow any trend. ‘Just because a couple of Voguettes have given it their stamp of approval, we loyal M&S customers are meant to flock like good little style sheep to get our hands on one, too,’ she said. ‘Can’t M&S see how patronising this is?’ For this suede skirt didn’t work in the Seventies and it doesn’t really work now. When I was young, most suede skirts and jackets were stiff, unyielding garments produced in a gingery tan colour that didn’t flatter anyone — especially those of us with gingery, tan-coloured hair — and it often felt like wearing thick cardboard. Sadly, this reincarnation gave me flashbacks. The unsuppleness and heavy feel of the suede may mean it will last for ages, but you’ll know about it while you’re wearing it: the waistband is far from forgiving and I can’t imagine it will give much across the hips when you sit down, making it stick out unattractively in front. I’m not crazy about the mid-calf length, either. Unless you have the endless legs of a model, it’s hard to carry off. It would look better with boots, of course, but with spring already here I’m hoping those can be left in the wardrobe. And I can’t see how the white stitching on hips and tummy can be flattering. Sorry, M&S, I’m giving it just three out of five: wearable for a few outings, after which it would be confined to the back of my wardrobe, never to be worn again. A costly foray into a brief trend — something that, at my age, I have mostly learned to avoid. UPDATED CLASSIC . Jane (pictured) loved this flattering suede dress from H&M, finding the whole outfit comfortable and well fitting, without the stiffness of some other suede garments . Wraparound suede dress, £199.99, hm.com . Suede block-heeled sandals, £129, reiss.com . Bangle, £39, reiss.com . Button diamond ring, £210, monicavinader.com . My favourite: It’s an excellent price and a beautiful and flattering berry colour, which suits most skin tones. The suede is wonderfully supple and comfortable and fits well. It certainly doesn’t have the stiffness that some other suede garments have, and the just-above-the-knee length is elegant and suits the shape of the dress. Who would have thought I’d want to be back in a wrap dress again? I thought we were over those for some time. The fabric updates this classic look. I love it — especially the great price. 5/5 . SHOULD YOU FAKE IT? The suede culottes Jane is sporting here did not get a good review with the stiff fabric and odd shape granting them a paltry 2/5 . Tweed top, £129, baukjen.com . Suedette culottes, £24.99, hm.com . Heels, £225, russellandbromley.co.uk . No! No! No! Culottes tend to look stiff and oddly shaped unless they’re made in a fluid fabric. These certainly don’t suit me, and I’m proving that here beyond any reasonable doubt. They cut off my legs at the least flattering part, the calves, and look more Dickensian urchin than fashion-forward fabulous. The faux fabric does feel like the real thing, but I suspect that it might crease. If I wanted some suede trousers I’d save up for a better design. 2/5 . COMFY AND CHIC . Jane (pictured) says this suede top may be worth the £249 you'd have to shell out to buy it. She found the item 'extremely chic and wearable', saying it would work with tight jeans or a smart skirt . Suede top, £249, baukjen.com . J. Brand jeans, £180, trilogystores.co.uk . Heels, £5, everything5pounds.com . Jewelled necklace, £85, stelladot.co.uk . Deceptively simple, this little suede top just might be a really good investment as it’s extremely chic and wearable, whether teamed with tight Brand jeans or a smart skirt. I love the boxy on-trend cut and the sleeve length makes it suitable for any occasion, as well as being long enough to keep the spring chill off and hide any imperfections. This suede is so thin and soft it feels like silk, and I like the tunic slit at the top. 4/5 . MAKE A SPLASH . Another top scorer was this lilac suede dress. Jane (pictured) says it fits beautifully, skimming fluidly over the body, with the colour adding to the classy look . Suede dress, £429, baukjen.com . Blue necklace, £50, stelladot.co.uk . Suede strappy sandals, £250, lkbennett.com . This fits so beautifully and skims fluidly over the body. Yes, it costs a lot, but it really does look expensive and the lilac is stunning and classy. The suede has an almost silky feel. I adored wearing this, but the danger of ruining it with smudges would make me wary of splashing out the serious cash. Remember that suede needs a lot more care than leather, tending to show rain spots and stains easily, and the soft top layer can wear off after a lot of use. It may be worth protecting expensive suede garments with a special spray, and they will also need expert cleaning. 4/5 .","Now it’s not often that I can claim to be ahead of a fashion trend.

"(CNN)""Good night Malaysian three-seven-zero."" It was a routine sign-off, an all-is-well. On March 8, 2014, at 1:19 a.m., someone spoke those last words from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 to air traffic controllers before the Boeing 777 vanished. A year later, searchers have no new clues as to where it went with 239 people on board. Radar and satellite reports have provided hints, but searchers still have nothing to hold in their hands. No wreckage seen floating at sea or beached on shore. No fuselage resting on the sea floor. Experts have said the data indicate the flight path from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing unexpectedly veered, putting the commercial jet over the southern Indian Ocean. But the water's vast and intricate depths have revealed no secrets. And as clarity has eluded grasp, analysts have made many speculations about what happened. The most controversial idea: Is the maritime search area all wrong? Did the plane land clandestinely on solid ground? Here are some expert theories about what happened to MH370. Investigators have since cast doubt on some of their details. Who radioed those last words to air traffic control? Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah? First officer Fariq Abdul Hamid? There was much speculation over that, but the Malaysian inspectors in April said it was Zaharie. The pilots were supposed to check in with new air traffic controllers in Vietnam, but never did. One theory is that one pilot may have incapacitated the other, then guided the plane to its end, taking the passengers down with him in a dramatic suicide. Mark Weiss, a retired American Airlines captain, has flown a Boeing 777. He believed shortly after the crash that there may have been a struggle. ""It was one of the pilots that maybe had a meltdown or did something nefarious to the airplane,"" he said. But Malaysia Airlines Chief Executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya has vehemently defended his employees, particularly the pilot. ""We do not suspect any one of our crew until there's such evidence. ... Captain Zaharie is a very capable man,"" he said. ""We have no reason to suspect (him)."" Weiss also thought there could have been another person -- a crew member or someone else -- in the cockpit who ""was bent on perhaps committing suicide or doing some destruction on the aircraft."" Copilot Hamid, 27, reportedly once invited a woman and her friend into the cockpit on a 2011 flight between Thailand and Malaysia. ""That's an enormous breach of security,"" Weiss said. But investigators punched holes in the idea, saying there was no indication of a third party in the cockpit, CNN reported in April. The difference between hijacking and commandeering is nuanced. The former term is often used when the hijacker issues a demand such as being taken to a safe-haven country or receiving ransom to release passengers. When people commandeer a plane, they might keep the motives secret, said political analyst Peter Bergen. They may want to steer it themselves at a target, like the September 11, 2001, terrorists did. In 1994, a FedEx employee burst into the cockpit of FedEx Flight 705 with a hammer and spear gun. He wanted to crash the plane into the company's Memphis, Tennessee, headquarters. The crew thwarted that takeover. ""Commandeering would fit with the few facts that we do know, and (it's) certainly a theory that we haven't heard a lot of that isn't a conspiracy,"" Bergen said. Experts are divided on this theory, partly because no terrorists have claimed responsibility at a moment when they would have the world's attention -- unless potential terrorists were waiting for something. MH370 went to Kazakhstan. Outlandish conjecture or genius insight? The theory that Russian actors on board MH370 found a way to get the plane through the border territory of China, Pakistan and India to a Kazakh landing strip leased to Russia comes from science journalist and private pilot Jeff Wise. Fleets of ships and search aircraft are looking in the wrong direction, he says. The airliner went north, not south. Investigators may have misinterpreted a key component of the Inmarsat satellite data. ""This is not a normal investigation. They need to throw out the book,"" Wise has said. Another aviation analyst, David Soucie, also cast doubt after MH370 went missing on the most widely held belief that the plane hit the Indian Ocean. ""If it had crashed in the way that we think it did, which is to run out of fuel and hit the water and break up into pieces, there would be pieces somewhere,"" he said. But Michael Exner, an engineer with decades of experience in the mobile satellite communications industry, says the data ""accurately and unambiguously"" shows MH370 went down near the so-called 7th arc, a path along which the search has been focused. ""The current ATSB search strategy remains the best search strategy,"" he said. In a less sinister but equally lethal explanation, some experts theorized the plane mysteriously crashed somewhere because of mechanical malfunction. Perhaps the electronics died, or a fire broke out, preventing the pilots from communicating. Maybe they turned to look for a landing strip but couldn't steer the plane properly. Pilots had trouble embracing the thought. ""I've been running that in my brain now ever since this thing happened,"" said Jim Tilmon, an aviation expert and retired American Airlines pilot. ""One possibility would be a total electrical failure which is very, very hard to imagine because (the plane) has so many generators coming from different places,"" Tilmon said. If they fail, there are other backups. He has said he's never heard of anything like it happening before. For months after MH370 disappeared, Malaysian officials reported details of the search to next of kin and the public. Something would be spotted, hopes rose, and then it didn't pan out. Hopes were dashed; anguish returned. Sunday, a year to the day after the plane disappeared, the international independent investigation committee released an interim report on the disappearance of MH370. It found no indications of unusual behavior among the aircraft's pilots and cabin crew before it took off, and said that Zaharie had had no personal or financial problems that would cast suspicion on him. The interim report also revealed that the battery of the underwater locator beacon on the plane's flight data recorder had expired more than a year before its disappearance. The battery on the plane's other so-called black box, the cockpit voice recorder, had been replaced as scheduled, and remained within its expiry date, the report said. CNN's Pamela Boykoff and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","(CNN)""Good night Jennifersiden three-seven-zero."" It was a routine sign-off, an all-is-well.

"Sunday nights may never be the same again. ITV confirmed yesterday that the sixth series of Downton Abbey will be the very last after ratings for the programme started to dip. At the height of its success, more than 9.51million viewers sat down to watch the period drama, which depicted the lives of those upstairs and downstairs in early 20th century Britain. Scroll down for video . Flagging figures: It has been confirmed that the next series of Downton Abbey will be the last after a drop in viewing figures for recent series of the show . However, by the opening episode of the last season, that figure had dropped to 8.43million. 'Inevitably there comes a time when all shows should end and Downton is no exception,' Executive Producer Gareth Neame said in a statement on Thursday. TV bosses added that they wanted to go out on a high. While the news will come as a massive blow to fans, the hugely successful show has set many of its stars on the path to showbiz success. In celebration of the Crawleys and all those who served them, Femail looks at the brightest new talent to come out of the manor..... LILY JAMES, 24, LADY ROSE MACCLARE . Before being cast in Downton, Lily actually played a starring role in the hit TV series Secret Diary Of A Call Girl alongside Billie Piper. Lily played Polly, one of Belle's fellow call girls. Prior to this, Lily had a role in the TV series Just William as Ethel Brown. Since taking part in the hit series as Lady Rose Macclare, Lily has swapped life on the small screen for life in the movies. The star  is currently promoting her biggest film to date: Cinderella. Lily plays Cinders in the latest Disney adaptation of the fairy tale. It's not all fairytales though. Lily has also taken a role in Pride and Predjudice Zombies, a zombified adaptation of the Jane Austen novel, which is due for release later this year. Belle of the ball: 24-year-old Lily James has seen huge success this year; she is currently promoting the new Cinderella film in which she stars as Cinderella herself . Now cast in a blockbuster: Lily played Lady Rose MacClare in Downton, pictured here in period dress . MICHELLE DOCKERY, 33, LADY MARY CRAWLEY . It was from the stage that Michelle Dockery took the leap onto the set of Downton in 2010 to play Lady Mary, who became one of the most popular characters. From her relationship with Matthew Crawley (played by Dan Stevens) to playing a larger role in the running of Downton, she's had some of the most talked-about story lines.

"Just a few years ago, Lesley Hutchinson was worried her partner Chris Coulter would die in his sleep because of severe breathing problems brought on by his excess weight. Now the couple, from Newcastle upon Tyne, have shed nearly 22 stone between them – with Chris losing more than half his body weight – and have compiled a 'slim list' of things they plan to do to celebrate their amazing achievement. Tipping the scales at 29st 5lbs Chris, 51, suffered with sleep apnoea, which regularly saw him stop breathing in his sleep, and 55-year-old Lesley feared one day he might not wake up.

Chris and Lesley, who have been together for 25 years, began to have weight problems around 15 years ago. Chris said: 'We stopped smoking and replaced cigarettes with snacks like crisps, sandwiches and pies. Around the same time we got a second car so didn't need to walk places anymore. 'Then when the kids – I have two daughters and Lesley has one daughter from previous relationships – left home we fell into the habit of eating more takeaways and washing them down with a bottle of wine.' A low point: Chris was left mortified after a wooden chair collapsed underneath him at a family barbecue. At that point, he decided that losing weight was his only option . The couple, pictured before their weightloss, began to have weight problems around 15 years ago when they began to replace cigarettes with snacks . However things changed when, in summer 2010, Chris was left mortified after a wooden chair collapsed beneath him at a family barbecue. The garden furniture broke into pieces and cut into Chris' leg, which became infected with cellulitis and worsened and ulcerated because of his weight. Soon after, Chris suffered further embarrassment when he was unable to fit into a hotel shower and the couple had to request a new room. So when his doctor, who was a Slimming World member herself, recommended Chris join his local group in May 2011, he decided losing weight was his only option.

Chris, pictured at 29st 5lbs on a camping holiday, regularly stopped breathing in his sleep . Chris said: 'My leg was in a real mess and it was getting to the point where they didn't know what else to do, I started to worry that I might actually lose my leg. 'I knew I had to do something about my weight. I was embarrassed and worried because I thought I'd be the only man in a roomful of women, so Lesley agreed to come with me. 'As soon as we walked through the doors though, we were warmly welcomed and made to feel comfortable – it was nothing like we'd expected. Now I can't wait to go to group every week.'

In his first week Chris lost 8.5lbs and since then he has gone on to lose a total of 17st 2lbs, going from 29st 5lbs to 12st 3lbs, and dropped 32 inches from his waist. His health problems are gone and he's discovered a passion for healthy eating: 'Our tastes have changed completely since we started slimming. 'We don't even want the foods we used to enjoy because the meals that we make at home are so much nicer. The pair joined Slimming World's programme and swapped their unhealthy diets for home-cooked meals. Chris shed a total of 17st 2lb and Lesley lost 4st 9lbs .

Dinner: Spaghetti bolognese with cheese on top and a garlic bread baguette, a takeaway from the local chip shop or a pizza . Snacks: Crisps, sandwiches, cheese and biscuits, pasties . She says the couple are much more active thanks to their weight loss, especially with their four grandchildren: 'We go camping in Wales every year. Before we used to just sit in our extra-large camping chairs and watch the kids running around. 'Now we're running around with them, swimming with them, and it's much more fun. It's really important to us because you don't get those times back.' Chris and Lesley are also keen walkers and have climbed the highest peak in Mid Wales twice, and Chris enjoys cycling and finds a round of golf much easier nowadays. In fact, the pair have so much more energy that they decided to compile a 'slim list' of places they'd like to visit and things they'd like to do minus their extra 21st 11lbs, which includes travelling to Paris, Venice and Dublin and re-visiting the Royal Albert Hall so that they can fit comfortably into the seats. Lesley says: 'We'd never been abroad as a couple, we wouldn't have dreamed of trying to go on a plane because Chris would never have fit into the seats.

At his heaviest, 51-year-old Chris was 29st 5lb, but went on to lose more than half his original body weight (right). He now tips the scales at 12 stone 3lb . 'Now we've been to Venice and to Paris and we had a brilliant time. It's like a whole new world has opened up for us. 'Before we lost weight we didn't have a life, we just sat around the house. We didn't really go anywhere or do anything, we didn't enjoy ourselves. Now things are completely different. Breakfast: Porridge with berries or a full English breakfast (grilled instead of fried) Mid-morning: A piece of fresh fruit . Lunch: Homemade soup or jacket potato topped with beans and salad . Mid-afternoon: A fat-free yogurt and another piece of fruit . Dinner: Homemade cheese burger with Slimming World-style chips (baked in the oven), peas and pickles or a homemade curry with rice. Snacks: Fresh fruit, fat-free yogurts, homemade frittata, scotch eggs and onion bhajis . 'My only regret is that we didn't do something sooner. I'd been worried about Chris' health for a long time and I dread to think how bad it might have got, but I didn't say anything because I thought it was kinder not to upset him. 'I was completely in denial about my own weight too, but when I look back I realise how unhappy I was. 'I would hide behind big baggy clothes and always turned down invitations to parties and events. We both wish we'd been honest with ourselves and with each other. 'We've done it now though, and the only way is forward – after all, we've got to make up for all the things we missed out on in our 30s and 40s.' Chris says: 'While it's obviously not why we joined Slimming World in the first place, it's amazing to be the Couple of the Year. 'Going on this journey together has been so important because it's meant we've had the other person to bounce ideas off and support from each other, as well as from our Consultant Adam and the rest of the group. 'I couldn't be more proud of Lesley and of myself, too.'","Just a few years ago, Mathew Morris was worried her partner Brent Hodge would die in his sleep because of severe breathing problems brought on by his excess weight.

In fact, the pair have so much more energy that they decided to compile a 'slim list' of places they'd like to visit and things they'd like to do minus their extra 21st 11lbs, which includes travelling to Elizabethside, Jamieville and New Erin and re-visiting the Royal Albert Hall so that they can fit comfortably into the seats. Mathew Morris says: 'We'd never been abroad as a couple, we wouldn't have dreamed of trying to go on a plane because Brent Hodge would never have fit into the seats. Brent Hodge, pictured before his weight loss, said he would dine on spaghetti bolognese with cheese on top and a garlic bread baguette, a takeaway from the local chip shop or a pizza for dinner . At his heaviest, 51-year-old Brent Hodge was 29st 5lb, but went on to lose more than half his original body weight (right). He now tips the scales at 12 stone 3lb . 'Now we've been to Jamieville and to Elizabethside and we had a brilliant time. It's like a whole new world has opened up for us. 'Before we lost weight we didn't have a life, we just sat around the house. We didn't really go anywhere or do anything, we didn't enjoy ourselves. Now things are completely different. Breakfast: Porridge with berries or a full English breakfast (grilled instead of fried) Mid-morning: A piece of fresh fruit . Lunch: Homemade soup or jacket potato topped with beans and salad . Mid-afternoon: A fat-free yogurt and another piece of fruit . Dinner: Homemade cheese burger with Slimming World-style chips (baked in the oven), peas and pickles or a homemade curry with rice. Snacks: Fresh fruit, fat-free yogurts, homemade frittata, scotch eggs and Grant Strickland . 'My only regret is that we didn't do something sooner. I'd been worried about Brent Hodge' health for a long time and I dread to think how bad it might have got, but I didn't say anything because I thought it was kinder not to upset him. 'I was completely in denial about my own weight too, but when I look back I realise how unhappy I was. 'I would hide behind big baggy clothes and always turned down invitations to parties and events. We both wish we'd been honest with ourselves and with each other. 'We've done it now though, and the only way is forward – after all, we've got to make up for all the things we missed out on in our 30s and 40s.' Brent Hodge says: 'While it's obviously not why we joined Slimming World in the first place, it's amazing to be the Couple of the Year. 'Going on this journey together has been so important because it's meant we've had the other person to bounce ideas off and support from each other, as well as from our Consultant Timothy Khan and the rest of the group. 'I couldn't be more proud of Mathew Morris and of myself, too.'"

"Rings of gas and dust are known to encircle Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune. Scientists recently discovered a fifth member of this haloed group known as Chariklo, which is one of a class of minor 'centaur' planets. Now astronomers have detected a possible ring system around a second centaur, Chiron, suggesting that ringed bodies may be more common in our solar system previously thought. Scientists have detected a possible Saturn-like ring system (pictured) around a minor, Chiron, suggesting that ringed bodies may be more common in our solar system previously thought . Like their mythological counterparts, centaurs are hybrids, embodying traits of both asteroids and comets. Today, scientists estimate there are more than 44,000 centaurs in the solar system, concentrated mainly in a band between the orbits of Jupiter and Pluto. Chiron, discovered in 1977, was the first planetary body categorised as a centaur, after the mythological Greek creature -- a hybrid of man and beast. To discover the rings, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology observed the dimming of a star as Chiron passed in front of it, briefly blocking the light. By looking at how much and when the light was blocked, scientists say the centaur may possess a circulating disk of debris. 'It's interesting, because Chiron is a centaur - part of that middle section of the solar system, between Jupiter and Pluto, where we originally weren't thinking things would be active, but it's turning out things are quite active,' says Amanda Bosh, a lecturer in MIT's Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences. It follows the discovery of rings around a giant asteroid called Chariklo last year. 'I try to imagine how it would be to stand on the surface of this icy object, small enough that a fast sports car could reach escape velocity and drive off into space, and stare up at a 20 kilometer wide ring system 1,000 times closer than the moon,' said Uffe Gråe Jørgensen of the University of Copenhagen of the Chariklo study.

Today, scientists estimate there are more than 44,000 centaurs in the solar system, concentrated mainly in a band between the orbits of Jupiter and Pluto.

Chiron was discovered in 1977 by Charles Kowal recovery images have been found as far back as 1895, it was the first-known member of a class of objects now known as centaurs, with an orbit between Saturn and Uranus . Starting in the late 1980s, astronomers observed patterns of brightening from the centaur, as well as activity similar to that of a streaking comet. In 2010, MIT started to chart the orbits of Chiron and nearby stars in order to pinpoint exactly when the centaur might pass across a star bright enough to detect. 'There's an aspect of serendipity to these observations,' Professor Bosh says. 'We need a certain amount of luck, waiting for Chiron to pass in front of a star that is bright enough. Chiron itself is small enough that the event is very short; if you blink, you might miss it.' In light of these new observations, the researchers say that Chiron may still possess symmetrical jets of gas and dust. But other interpretations may be equally valid, including the 'intriguing possibility,' Professor Bosh says, of a shell or ring of gas and dust. Pictured are the positions of known outer solar system objects. The centaurs are those objects (in green) that lie generally inwards of the Kuiper belt (in blue) Ruprecht, who is a researcher at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory, says it is possible to imagine a scenario in which centaurs may form rings. For example, when a body breaks up, the resulting debris can be captured gravitationally around another body, such as Chiron. Rings can also be leftover material from the formation of Chiron itself. Nevertheless, Bosh says the possibility of a second ringed centaur in the solar system is an enticing one. 'Until Chariklo's rings were found, it was commonly believed that these smaller bodies don't have ring systems,' Bosh says.

Berra came through the ranks at Tynecastle where the legendary midfielder ruled supreme in the late 1950s.

Berra celebrates his late goal, which was one of the few memorable moments in a game lacking intensity . The Ipswich Town centre back celebrates with his team-mates after securing the win five minutes from time . 'I met him a couple of times when I was at Hearts,' Berra recalled of Mackay. 'He was a confident person. I think it was the way he played, he wasn't shy and had a great career with Scotland, Hearts and Spurs. 'A great deal of respect has been shown to him in football, especially British football. 'So I'm especially pleased I scored tonight. He was strong and could bully people and was a player people could relate to. He had a great career and that minute's applause was great for him and his family. 'It was good to get a goal. That was my first Scotland appearance in a long time and it meant a lot to get 45 minutes. To also score a goal was even better. 'I'd almost scored from a corner five minutes before the goal when I had a header at the front post. I maybe should have done better. 'I said to Matt (Ritchie) to hang it up a bit and it was there to go and attack. I stuck my head on it and thankfully it went into the back of the net. The teams observed a minute's applause for the late Dave McKay before the game at Hampden Park . 'It's my third goal for Scotland and my sixth of the season. As a defender, it' s good to add goals to my name.' Despite heading his second career goal against Northern Ireland, Berra believes he will return to the bench when Gibraltar come calling on Sunday. 'Obviously I am down the pecking order,' he added. 'I just have to be patient and play well for my club and hopefully my international chance will come again.' Until Berra's late intervention, it was a night of missed opportunities in more ways than one. Steven Fletcher, without an international goal since his one and only strike against Iceland almost six years ago, saw a couple of decent chances come and go. Had the occasion been anything other than a friendly, he would have been beating himself up about it. But perhaps the prospect of what should be a turkey shoot against Gibraltar on Sunday allowed him a degree of comfort. 'I'm looking to get back on the score sheet as soon as possible,' he said. 'It' s been a while. For me, tonight was just about getting some minutes under my belt. 'I've not played too much this year so it feels good to get back out there. It doesn't prey on my mind. If I wasn't getting chances, I'd be complaining but I' m getting them so I just need to start taking them.' Crowds clap whilst the Hearse carrying the coffin of Dave Mackay leaves Tyncastle Stadium for his funeral . Asked if becoming the first Scotland player since Colin Stein to net a hat-trick come the weekend was an added incentive, Fletcher quipped: 'I need to get a goal just now never mind a hat-trick. Listen, if we get the opportunities hopefully we can take them. 'If that means one of us getting a few then great. First and foremost, we just want to get the goals that give us a win and push up the table.' So much for two Celtic nations nipping the life out of each other as they sought a miniscule psychological edge to take into their remaining Euro qualifiers. Friendly was what it said on the ticket and, by heavens that is what we got. At the conclusion of a remarkably featureless and benign game it was tempting to ask if much had been gained from it. But, despite the lack of goals, Fletcher believed it was the perfect work-out ahead of Gibraltar on Sunday. Scotland captain Darren Fletcher issues instructions from his position in front of the back four . 'It was good preparation,' he insisted. 'A few of the boys like myself having been playing too much football so it was good to get a few minutes. 'It's another win which keeps the momentum going. There's another big game on Sunday which we are all looking forward to. 'If we'd got an earlier goal, it would have been a bit more comfortable but at least we got one. It's good. 'We could have been ahead earlier. We'd a few chances in the first half – I'd a few myself. 'I'm going to blame the goalie for the one I missed and not myself. In fairness, he pulled off a few good saves although it was frustrating we never got the goal before we did. But the win keeps us going for the weekend. 'Both teams obviously had one eye on the games that really matter at the weekend. You could see that with the changes that were made. 'Both managers wanted to keep everyone's legs fresh. Both nations have got two big games coming up.' Fletcher attempted to temper the expectation that Sunday's game will be a total formality. 'We're not going in there thinking we're going to run them into the ground,' he insisted. 'We just want to put on a performance that the gaffer sets us out to do and if we do that hopefully we can get the win. 'Goal difference doesn't matter against them but it will matter in terms of confidence. We've got a massive game against Ireland in the summer so if we can get a win and a few goals it will be happy days.'","Joseph Powell dedicated his third Whitemouth goal to Mary Jacqueline Floreshews – the day after the Hearts and Tottenham legend was laid to rest.

The teams observed a minute's applause for the late Mary Jacqueline Floreshews Mary Ramos before the game at Hampden Park . 'It's my third goal for Whitemouth and my sixth of the season. As a defender, it' s good to add goals to my name.' Despite heading his second career goal against Jacksonview, Joseph Powell believes he will return to the bench when West Mary come calling on Sunday. 'Obviously I am down the pecking order,' he added. 'I just have to be patient and play well for my club and hopefully my international chance will come again.' Until Joseph Powell's late intervention, it was a night of missed opportunities in more ways than one. Marvin Smith, without an international goal since his one and only strike against Lisaport almost six years ago, saw a couple of decent chances come and go. Had the occasion been anything other than a friendly, he would have been beating himself up about it. But perhaps the prospect of what should be a turkey shoot against West Mary on Sunday allowed him a degree of comfort. 'I'm looking to get back on the score sheet as soon as possible,' he said. 'It' s been a while. For me, tonight was just about getting some minutes under my belt. 'I've not played too much this year so it feels good to get back out there. It doesn't prey on my mind. If I wasn't getting chances, I'd be complaining but I' m getting them so I just need to start taking them.' Crowds clap whilst the Hearse carrying the coffin of Mary Jacqueline Floreshews leaves Tyncastle Stadium for his funeral . Asked if becoming the first Whitemouth player since Phillip George to net a hat-trick come the weekend was an added incentive, Marvin Smith quipped: 'I need to get a goal just now never mind a hat-trick. Listen, if we get the opportunities hopefully we can take them. 'If that means one of us getting a few then great. First and foremost, we just want to get the goals that give us a win and push up the table.' So much for two Celtic nations nipping the life out of each other as they sought a miniscule psychological edge to take into their remaining Euro qualifiers. Friendly was what it said on the ticket and, by heavens that is what we got. At the conclusion of a remarkably featureless and benign game it was tempting to ask if much had been gained from it. But, despite the lack of goals, Marvin Smith believed it was the perfect work-out ahead of West Mary on Sunday. Whitemouth captain Russell Bennett Marvin Smith issues instructions from his position in front of the back four . 'It was good preparation,' he insisted. 'A few of the boys like myself having been playing too much football so it was good to get a few minutes. 'It's another win which keeps the momentum going. There's another big game on Sunday which we are all looking forward to. 'If we'd got an earlier goal, it would have been a bit more comfortable but at least we got one. It's good. 'We could have been ahead earlier. We'd a few chances in the first half – I'd a few myself. 'I'm going to blame the goalie for the one I missed and not myself. In fairness, he pulled off a few good saves although it was frustrating we never got the goal before we did. But the win keeps us going for the weekend. 'Both teams obviously had one eye on the games that really matter at the weekend. You could see that with the changes that were made. 'Both managers wanted to keep everyone's legs fresh. Both nations have got two big games coming up.' Marvin Smith attempted to temper the expectation that Sunday's game will be a total formality. 'We're not going in there thinking we're going to run them into the ground,' he insisted. 'We just want to put on a performance that the gaffer sets us out to do and if we do that hopefully we can get the win. 'Goal difference doesn't matter against them but it will matter in terms of confidence. We've got a massive game against New Karenside in the summer so if we can get a win and a few goals it will be happy days.'"
"At least one lab employee has tested positive for a deadly bacteria used to make bioweapons that mysteriously escaped a Louisiana research center in November. Additionally, the number of monkey's infected by the bioterror bacterium at the Tulane Prime Research Center has increased from eight to nine and are expected to continue rising, officials say. Three of the monkeys have already been euthanized after showing signs of Burkholderia pseudomallei, which was being studied in a secure lab in another part of the 500-acre facility. The test results showed the employee was 'just at the threshold for a verified positive result' and has not shown any symptoms of the diseases the bacteria can bring on, such as tuberculosis, according to NOLA.com. Despite thorough investigations by bothb federal and state authorities, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the cause of the contamination is still unknown. Concerns: Monkeys at the Tulane National Primate Research Center in Louisiana were exposed to a potentially deadly bacteria last fall - but authorities still do not know how or why it happened . Reach: Worryingly, the center is close to a river (top left), homes and a school. Although there are no signs that surrounding areas have been exposed to the bacteria, further tests are required . The name of the employee has not been released. Questions also remain over how far the bacteria, which is primarily found in southeast Asia and northeast Australia, has spread around the complex and surrounding areas. Animals pass it in their urine and feces - potentially contaminating the ground and water around them - and others can become infected through direct contact with the contaminated areas. The bacteria may not cause an illness until days or years after the exposure, but the illness can be fatal in humans and animals, according to USA Today. The monkeys, rhesus macaques, had access to massive outdoor primate breeding cages, where around 4,000 macaques are kept. It is not yet known if the bacteria have colonized in the cages. Worryingly, the research center is just half a mile from a school and surrounded by homes. And only yards behind the facility, there is a river that leads to a lake surrounded by wildlife refuges. The contaminated primates were all at the center's veterinary hospital at the same time last fall, leading to speculation that they could have been exposed there. Infected: At least seven rhesus macaques (file picture) have shown signs of exposure and three have died . Potentially deadly: Burkholderia pseudomallei . The bacteria, Burkholderia pseudomallei, can cause a potentially serious disease in people and animals called melioidosis. Melioidosis commonly involves the lungs and has a range of symptoms including fever, headache, appetite loss, muscle and joint pain. The illness may not develop for days to years. It is often mistaken as pneumonia or tuberculosis, and if left untreated, it is fatal. Several countries have looked into using the bacteria as a bioweapon because strains can be resistant to multiple antibiotics. The overall mortality rate is 40 per cent but in Thailand, where the bacteria is endemic, it is up to 50 per cent. The bacteria, which is primarily found in southeast Asia and northeast Australia, has never been found in nature in the U.S. Last week, tests by the CDC determined two further monkeys showed signs of contracting the bacteria, bring the number of infected monkeys to seven. The CDC will now be looking at safety and health practices at the veterinary hospital, the agency said. Richard Ebright, a biosafety expert from Rutgers University in New Jersey, previously told USA Today that the release was worrying. 'The fact that they can't identify how this release occurred is very concerning,' he said. 'Human error is always the first explanation you should consider for a laboratory accident. 'The easiest way to transfer something from one place where it's supposed to be, to another where it isn't supposed to be is by a worker moving from one place to the other.' State officials are planning to test wildlife and domestic animals around the facility to see if they have been exposed. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is also working on information to give animal owners, veterinarians and laboratories on what signs to look for to determine if animals have been exposed. Authorities have previously said they are concerned that too few samples have been taken to decide whether livestock and domestic animals are at risk. Only 39 soil samples were taken from the grounds and 13 from water - far less than the 100 recommended by previous research completed in Thailand. Those results showed that there was no evidence that the bacteria had spread into the surrounding area, suggesting there was no public health risk.","At least one lab employee has tested positive for a deadly bacteria used to make bioweapons that mysteriously escaped a Port Williambury research center in November.

"Surgeons have carried out the UK’s first transplant of a non-beating heart. Donor hearts are usually from people who are brain-stem dead, but whose hearts are still beating. In this case, the organ came from a donor after their heart and lungs had stopped functioning. Surgeons at Papworth Hospital in Cambridgeshire restored function to the heart before placing it on an Organ Care System to maintain its quality before it was transplanted. It is the first time such a procedure has been performed in Europe. Surgeons at Papworth Hospital in Cambridgeshire restored function to the heart before placing it on an Organ Care System to maintain its quality before it was transplanted to 60-year-old Huseyin Ulucan from London . Recipient Huseyin Ulucan, 60, from London, who underwent surgery earlier this month, had a heart attack in 2008. He said: ‘Before the surgery, I really had no quality of life. Now I’m feeling stronger every day.’ The hospital said Mr Ulucan was making ‘remarkable progress’ after spending only four days in its critical care unit before being allowed to go home. Currently not everyone who needs a heart transplant can have one due to there not being enough suitable ones available. However, it is hoped that by using non-beating hearts, the number of people able to have heart transplants could increase by  up to 25 per cent in the UK alone, saving hundreds of lives. Last year, surgeons in Australia performed the world’s first transplant using a non-beating heart. Consultant surgeon Stephen Large, who led the Papworth transplant team, said: ‘The use of this group of donor hearts could increase heart transplantation by up to 25 per cent in the UK alone.’ There have been 171 heart transplant in the past 12 months in the UK. But demand exceeds supply, and some patients have to wait up to three years for a suitable organ, with many dying on the waiting list. Non-beating-heart donors provide kidneys, livers and other organs, but until now it has not been possible to use the heart because of concerns it would suffer damage. Huseyin Ulucan, from London (pictured with wife Meryem), who became the first person in Europe to receive the surgery following a heart attack in 2008, said he is 'feeling stronger every day' following the operation . Mr Large added: ‘This is a very exciting development. By enabling the safe use of this kind of donor hearts, we could significantly increase the total number of heart transplants each year, saving hundreds of lives.’ The first successful transplant carried out using the Organ Care System – also known as ‘heart in a box’ – took place in St Vincent’s Hospital in Sydney last year, involving a heart that had stopped beating for 20 minutes. The system allows the donor heart to be connected to a sterile circuit of blood which restores the heartbeat and keeps it warm, limiting the adverse effects associated with previous methods which saw hearts kept on ice. Using the preservative solution and the heart in a box, the organ is able to be reanimated, preserved and assessed until it is ready to go into a recipient. It is not clear how long after it stopped beating that the doctors at Papworth restarted the heart. They used ultrasound to assess the function of the restarted heart for 50 minutes before approving it for transplantation. They then removed it from the donor, placed it in the heart-in-a-box machine which perfused the organ with blood and nutrients, and kept it beating for three hours until the operation went ahead. The Organ Care System (OCS), developed by TransMedics, allows donor hearts to continue functioning in a near-perfect state outside the body during transport and until it is placed into the body of the recipient . ‘This is a phenomenal achievement,’ said Simon Messer, cardiothoracic transplant registrar at the hospital. ‘People who previously would not get a heart transplant will now be able to have them.’ More than 250 patients in Britain are on the waiting list for heart transplants, and around 900,000 people in the UK are living with heart failure, according to the British Heart Foundation. Mr Messer added: ‘Currently patients can wait over three years for a heart transplant. But less than half of the people on the waiting list will be transplanted. ‘About 13 per cent die while they are waiting, and around 30 per cent are removed from the list, because they become too unwell to have the operation.’","Surgeons have carried out the North Ronaldtown’s first transplant of a non-beating heart.

"(CNN)It may not provide the answer to life, the universe and everything, but when the Large Hadron Collider at Geneva's CERN starts up again this month, particle physicists are planning to give this question their best shot. Having finally nailed down the elusive Higgs boson particle in 2013 -- the elementary particle that has unlocked some of the universe's longest-standing secrets -- physicists are now on the trail of dark matter. And with the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) -- the 27km (17 mile) circumference particle accelerator that occupies a tunnel on the Franco-Swiss border -- now tricked out with new magnets, more powerful energy beams and a tighter vacuum, scientists are hoping to shine a light on some of the universe's more arcane phenomena. ""Higgs was the final piece of the jigsaw of what we call the Standard Model of particle physics,"" Dr Mike Lamont, operations group leader at the facility, told CNN. ""But we know that this model is not complete."" ""One of the big things we know is out there -- but we don't yet understand -- is dark matter. ""There's a lot of astronomical observations to support the fact that this stuff exists, so this is one thing that we might hope shows up."" Dark matter is currently a hypothesis. It is a type of matter that can't be seen but whose presence can be inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation and even the very structure of the universe. Physicists believe this unseen material makes up about 85 percent of all the matter in the universe. Regular matter, which we are made of along with all the stars, planets and other tangible cosmic material, accounts for just around 4 percent of the mass-energy of the known universe. In other words, the vast majority of what constitutes reality still eludes us. Particle physicists will no doubt be on the edge of their seats when the new souped-up collider is put through its paces this month, although it can take months for the data to be processed. ""There are a number of theories that give you dark matter candidates -- one of the favourites is supersymmetry,"" Lamont said, adding that the team got no sign of it at all in the facility's first three-year run. ""What the physicists are hoping is that with the step up in energy we will be able to explore a bit more of parameter space and that something dramatically new will show up. ""If it does, it's Nobel prizes all around; it really will be a major breakthrough. If it's not, then it's back to the drawing board."" The increased energy of the new collider will be key to the new studies. The energy of collisions in the LHC in 2015 will be 13 TeV (teraelectron volt) compared with 8 TeV in 2012 during its last run. While the facility is a big industrial user of power -- about 180MW when it's running at full tilt -- it's not quite powerful enough to dim the lights or send the air-conditioning down in surrounding areas. ""We have a dial that tells us how much energy we're using - it would be equivalent to about 10% of the total power in the Geneva canton,"" Lamont said. But anyone expecting a ""Bride of Frankenstein"" scenario of flashing lights and crackling electrical discharges is going to be disappointed. According to Lamont, while the machine is tremendously powerful, it operates within a vacuum, making it relatively quiet. ""The beam itself does hum, we can hear it oscillating, but the collision energy between one proton and another -- while it's a huge amount of energy for a proton -- is like a house fly hitting another house fly at 5 miles per hour. ""The beam, however, does have a huge amount of energy and we have to be very careful with it."" He said the proton beam is launched at a tangent to the ring and when the energy of the beam needs to be absorbed, they use a graphite block to damp it. ""Now that really does give a good bang,"" Lamont said. ""We had microphones down there and this you could hear."" While there are billions of protons per package sent hurtling through the collider at a rate of 11,000 times per second, only 20 or 30 protons per package will actually collide to produce an effect that can be studied. Scientist must monitor equipment that registers hundreds of millions of collisions per second typically over 12-hour periods. ""The experiments need this because the interesting stuff like the Higgs is extremely rare. Only very rarely do these collisions produce something interesting and this is the big challenge for us -- to trigger the interesting stuff,"" he said. The Higgs may have gone a long way to answering the questions thrown up by the Standard Model, but Lamont says there will still be plenty of good physics to be examined by what is effectively the world's biggest machine. ""We're planning a major upgrade in 2023-25 -- there'll be new more powerful focusing magnets installed and some other upgrades and this will allow us to multiply by five the number of collisions we can deliver. ""That program is planned out until 2035 ... there are some interesting milestones coming up."" He remains sanguine, however, about the possibility that after weeks of collisions and months and sometimes years of study, scientists and researchers may have actually moved further away from answering the mysteries and paradoxes of particle physics beyond the Standard Model. ""Maybe the universe is a bit simpler than we think it is,"" Lamont said. Read more from Make, Create, Innovate: .

"Ecstatic mom Sarah Palin is over the moon with her daughter Bristol's engagement to 'American hero' and Medal of Honor winner Sgt Dakota Meyer. The former Alaska governor and one-time Vice Presidential candidate wrote a gushing response to the news on Saturday, hours after Bristol, 24, announced that she and the 26-year-old Marine were to be wed. Palin wrote on Facebook that she and the rest of her clan are 'honored to welcome Dakota into our family'. Welcome to the family! Sarah Palin posted a gushing response to the engagement of her daughter Bristol, right, to Sgt Dakota Meyer, left . Gushing: Sarah Palin and Meyer met while filming Palin's Amazing America series, above. She had invited the Medal of Honor winner to appear in the first season's final episode, filmed in Alaska . Announcement: Bristol, 24, shared her wedding plans with the world by posting the above photograph of her and Meyer kissing. He proposed at a pop concert on Friday evening in the Hard Rock Casino, Las Vegas . Palin also outed her future son-in-law as a die-hard traditionalist, revealing how he flew to Alaska a week before the proposal to ask Bristol's father, Todd Palin, and grandfather, Chuck Heath Snr, for their permission. The Republican poster girl was herself a key part of their first meeting. In the post she took the chance to recount her role bringing the two together by inviting Meyer to Alaska to film an episode of her Amazing America TV show. The post came as Meyer himself spoke out about his proposal, which he made on one knee at a concert by pop group Rascal Flatts on Friday evening in the Hard Rock Casino, Las Vegas. Noting that Bristol 'makes me a better man', he said he 'can't wait to spend the rest of my life with her and Tripp', her six-year-old son. Tripp was born to Bristol in 2008, when she was just 18, following her high-profile teen pregnancy, which was announced soon after Palin's bid for Vice President. In recent weeks Tripp and Meyer have been pictured playing together. Meyer also addressed the speed of their engagement, less than a year after they first met, saying: 'Marines aren't trained to stand around and let the grass grow under their feet'. It is unclear how long the pair have been dating, but in her engagement announcement Bristol implied they only saw one another infrequently at first. Social media pictures of the pair together only started appearing a few months ago. New family: Meyer is pictured above with Bristol and her six-year-old son, Tripp. Bristol has written repeatedly of how well Meyer gets along with her son, who was fathered by former flame Levi Johnston, to whom she was engaged twice before . Rock: Bristol followed the announcement image with this picture of her engagement ring . Bristol, even more excited than her mother, announced the engagement yesterday night on her Instagram page in a flurry of exclamation marks. She posted an image of the pair kissing, alongside the words: 'Truly the luckiest girl in the world, cannot wait to marry this man!!!!' It was quickly followed by a monochrome image of her finger adorned with a ring. The mother-of-one then uploaded a picture of her engagement ring and wrote a piece on her blog. It read: 'Last night, Sgt Dakota Meyer proposed and I said yes! 'Dakota came to Alaska to film Amazing America with my mom last year. He met Tripp during that time, and I’ve seen him in a few places where our paths have crossed since. Excitement: Meyer, who served in the Marines for four years, also gushed about the forthcoming nuptials . 'He’s visited us in Alaska, and I’ve visited his wonderful family in Kentucky. He’s wonderful with Tripp and I’m so proud to be marrying him. 'He’s so romantic! He asked me to marry him at a Rascal Flatts concert. The lead singer, Gary LeVox, dedicated Bless the Broken Road to us, and then Dakota got down on one knee and proposed! 'It’s amazing to see what happens when you place everything in life in God’s hands. He really is good and His plans are so much greater than our own.' Kentucky native Meyer, who served in the Marines for four years, said he is happier than he has been in years. First round: Palin also congratulated the pair on Twitter not long after the announcement . He wrote: 'Coming back from Afghanistan there were days I thought I may never be happy again, and I know there's a lot of you out there who know that feeling. 'We only have one life to live and we have to do our best to live it the right way, and Bristol makes me a better man. 'I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with her and Tripp. For the first time in a long time I can honestly say the best is yet to come! Thanks to everyone for your words of kindness and support. It means a ton to us.' Meyer was awarded the Medal of Honor in 2011 after repeatedly charging into a kill zone during a 2009 ambush in Kunar Province, Afghanistan in search of four of his missing soldiers. American hero: Meyer was awarded the Medal of Honor by Barack Obama in 2011 after repeatedly charging into a kill zone during a 2009 ambush in Kunar Province, Afghanistan in search of four missing soldiers . He was able to rescue 36 troops and kill eight Taliban attackers despite being shot in the arms. Although he did not save the four men he set out to find, he recovered their bodies and brought each of them to safety. He caused a stir in December for taunting ISIS members on social media - calling them cowards. He also wrote: 'Wonder if any ISIS members want to drop by and join my book club.' Since her mother's failed bid to become vice president in 2008, Bristol has appeared on Dancing with the Stars and featured in her own Lifetime show about raising her son, titled Bristol Palin: Life's a Tripp. She also released a best-selling memoir in 2011, Not Afraid of Life: My Journey So Far. Bristol broke up with ex-partner Johnston in 2009 and started an intense custody battle. However, in the midst of the battle, they also briefly reunited and were engaged again. But the match was short-livde and the two broke up again in the summer of 2010. Johnston has since married day-care worker Sunny Oglesby.

"France is one step closer to legalising euthanasia after approving a bill that allows doctors to sedate terminally ill patients until they die. The bill stops short of recommending lethal injections and avoids the terms euthanasia or assisted suicide, but would give people 'the right to deep, continuous sedation until death'. This must be at the patient's request, but only when their condition is life-threatening in the short-term. Protests: Demonstrators gather near the French National Assembly holding white silhouettes as part of a silent protest against euthanasia in Paris on March 10. Slogans read: 'Let's relieve but do not kill' On March 10. pro-euthanasia demonstrators held signs reading: 'Francois let's act like Holland'. Euthanasia has been taking place in Holland for many years . The proposed measure was passed by a vote of 436 to 34 in France's lower house of Parliament, and it must now be debated by the Senate. Backed by the Socialist government, the bill would also force doctors in France to follow end-of-life instructions expressed by the patients themselves, or written in advance if they are no longer able to state their wishes. Almost one in 20 people in northern Belgium died using euthanasia in 2013, more than doubling the numbers in six years, a study released today showed. The universities of Ghent and Brussels found that since euthanasia was legalised in 2002, the acceptance of ending a life at the patient's request has greatly increased. While a 2007 survey showed 1.9 percent of deaths from euthanasia in the region, the figure was 4.6 percent in 2013. 'Euthanasia has been increasingly accepted by the patients as a valid option at the end of their life,' said Ghent University ethics professor Freddy Mortier. 'Physicians themselves are more inclined to comply with the wishes of the patients."" Euthanasia is legal only in the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg . Earlier this month in a speech at France's lower house of Parliament, Prime minister Manuel Valls praised 'a reform that proclaims the right to die peacefully, in dignity and without suffering'. The bill has stirred debate in France and prompted a call for the preservation of 'the prohibition of killing' by five high-profile Christian, Muslim and Jewish leaders. It has prompted protests by those claiming the bill amounts to disguised euthanasia, as well as pro-euthanasia campaigners who believe it does not go far enough. Doctors are also divided about the idea. So-called terminal or 'palliative sedation' can involve medicating patients until they die naturally of their illnesses, or until they starve. The method does not actively kill patients, but some doctors say it can mean patients are sedated for weeks before they die, and that it may be more humane to euthanise. French debate over end-of-life legislation resurfaced last year over the case of comatose Frenchman Vincent Lambert. His wife wants doctors to stop life support but his parents disagree. The case is pending at the European Court of Human Rights.

The  mother, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, took photos of the incident on her camera phone which show Mr Davis tying her son's hands behind his back and ankles together. Scroll down for video . A mother wants to sue Dr Neville Goodwin Davis for compensation after he allegedly hog-tied her son . The unnamed mother claimed she screamed and broke down as she told Dr Davis to get off her son . Speaking to A Current Affair, the outraged mother claimed she screamed and broke down as she told Dr Davis to get off her son, who was being treated for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Fearing her son may have had Aspergers Syndrome, the mother raised concerns with Mr Davis but she never expected he would use a rope as a technique to control her son's behaviour. 'He just told me that he was going to prove to me that he didn't have Aspergers and that's when he [son] was tied up,' the distraught mother said. 'He told me an Aspergers child would be screaming their lungs out by now. That was his way of telling me he doesn't have Aspergers.' Aspergers syndrome is a condition that falls within the autism spectrum. People with the condition often have difficulty forming friendships and communicating with others, as well as having difficulty understanding social rules and interpreting the body language of others, according to the Victorian state health department. Despite her photo evidence, Dr Davis was hit with just a 12-month, $1000 good behaviour bond with no conviction recorded for the alleged assault. 'I am absolutely furious. I'll never have that closure that I needed to see him standing there getting the guilty verdict I knew he'd deserved,' the mother said. Dr  Davis (centre) has pleaded guilty of assault and allegedly sitting on the young boy's back  in October 2012 . The mother claims her son was seizure-free but after the consultation, he suffered a major seizure that night . The mother claimed that Dr Davis also threatened to flush her son's head down the toilet but he later denied the allegations in court. She claimed her son was seizure-free for two and a half years but following the consultation, the seven-year-old suffered a major seizure that night. 'He now has got severe anxiety. Everything is bitten, he bites holes in his shirt, he bites Wii controls, he bites them right through to the metal,' his mother said. She added that her son has been suffering high anxiety, triggering seizures causing calcium deposits on his brain with doctors fearing he may not survive for another five years. She said her son has been suffering seizures with doctors fearing he may not survive for another five years . Michelle Ridgen (pictured) also claims Dr Davis allegedly assaulted her five-year-old son 10 years ago . Another mother, Michelle Ridgen also claims Dr Davis carried out 'barbaric' acts when he treated her five-year-old son 10 years ago for behavioural problems. 'It's just unspeakable - it makes you feel sick in the stomach,' Ms Ridgen told A Current Affair. 'He told us this is the way to discipline your child - you just grab him by the hair, pull him to his feet,' she said. The Australian Medical Board has ruled Dr Davis 'must not treat, consult or assess a patient under the age of 18 years without the presence of a Committee approved chaperone'. He will face the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal on March 27 to determine whether he will result in a suspension or deregistration.

"The heat is on and there are contrasting statements from some of the Premier League’s most prominent managers. Manuel Pellegrini loftily announces that he has no need to win trophies to keep his job at Manchester City. Brendan Rodgers openly admits that unless he had put Liverpool back in the running for honours he would have been sacked. Louis van Gaal urgently instructs his Manchester United players to minimise passes back to their goalkeeper in an attempt to pacify fans who are demanding a return to the attacking style of Sir Alex Ferguson. Manuel Pellegrini claims he does not need to win trophies to hold on to the Manchester City reins . Louis van Gaal has told his players not to pass back to keeper David de Gea to improve United's tempo . Roberto Martinez airily falls back on the support of his chairman Bill Kenwright as Everton drift, as if rudderless, towards the rapids of the drop zone. Get real, Senors Pellegrini and Martinez. Right on, Mister Rodgers and Meneer Van Gaal. Complacency has never been a recipe for security in the football management game and you begin to fear for Pellegrini and Martinez as the season heads towards the home straight. Pellegrini’s calm intelligence and fine football principles have won our admiration but he is kidding himself if he truly believes it when he says: ‘I’m not under any pressure to win titles. It’s about playing with style. We won’t change. It’s not about my relationship with the owners. They are not so desperate to win.’ Oh, really? Good luck with that one if after they spend so much money you come up short of Chelsea in your defence of the Premier League title and Barca finish you off in the Champions League. And it didn’t look that good against gallant Leicester on Wednesday night. Martinez comes across as honest – albeit painfully so at times – as well as a smooth media operator but he may be taking a little too much for granted when he says: ‘I was always aware of the support I would get from the chairman.’ Roberto Martinez has suffered second season syndrome at Everton with the Toffees perilously perched . Brendan Rodgers was candid about his chances of survival before Liverpool's remarkable turnaround . Beware the good old vote of confidence, Roberto, and let’s hope you don’t come to re-evaluate something else you’ve just said about Mr Kenwright: ‘Bill is a mad Evertonian.’ Fanatical fans are not usually very forgiving of only one win in a run of a dozen games including that tepid defeat at Stoke. Rodgers and Van Gaal, meanwhile, are sensibly watching their backs. Not long ago I had occasion to chide Rodgers in this column for doing too much talking about himself but seemingly not enough work on a Liverpool team sliding into crisis. Since then he has seen the warning signs and cleverly switched to a positive 3-4-3 formation which has turned them into the form team of the Premier League and he freely declares now: ‘I’ve learned that if the team is not functioning it doesn’t matter how much support you have in the boardroom. You have to win.’ So it’s well done to him. Since losing to United on December 14, Liverpool have won nine and drawn three in the Premier League . Van Gaal is proving himself shrewd enough to know that sometimes not even a run of only two defeats in 21 matches is enough at a club as huge as United. The Old Trafford faithful are chanting ‘attack, attack, attack’ while his raft of expensive imports – including £60million record signing Angel di Maria – are struggling to comes to terms with the quick-fire culture of the game in England. And the manager hears them: ‘I agree with the fans that we don’t have to use the goalkeeper so much. That there are times when we could play at a higher tempo.’ United are approaching a potentially season-defining sequence of matches against Spurs, Liverpool, City and Chelsea in the League and Arsenal in the FA Cup quarter-finals and he promises: ‘We can improve.’ So it’s well done to him, too. This quartet are not the only managers sweating in the boiler room of big-time football. Heaven knows, for example, what poor old Gus Poyet was burbling on about in his bottle-kicking rant during Sunderland’s fractious draw at Hull this midweek. Or whether his sanity will hold up under the pressure of fighting to stave off relegation without his star England winger Adam Johnson following his arrest on suspicion of having sex with an underage girl. Angel di Maria trudges off to be substituted after another disappointing outing against Newcastle . Hull boss Steve Bruce and Sunderland's Gus Poyet played down their spat and have since shaken hands . The trapdoor is beginning to creak under some auspicious names. Don’t feel too sorry for them if it swings open. Unlike the great managers of yore – even Sir Alex was financially strapped in his early years astride the hot seat – these celebrities are paid millions to cope with the pressures. Like several of their more immediate predecessors, they would not necessarily be obliged to find another job after the pay-off. It’s mostly the pride that’s in danger of being hurt. There is one lesson above all others which England’s rugby goliaths need to heed from that Six Nations defeat in Ireland. Brawn alone will not be enough to win the World Cup this autumn, even on home turf. Stuart Lancaster’s pack is a monster, right enough, but you cannot simply shove, bore and batter your way to glory against the best teams on the planet in the Test matches which matter above all others. England will need more than a game based around brute force if they are to succeed in the World Cup . Ireland gave Chris Robshaw his men a lesson and the Red Rose will need to regroup - and add guile . You have to play some football, at least, when it comes to Ireland, probably France, even more so New Zealand. Sir Clive Woodward had Martin Johnson the Enforcer but he also got the sparkling best out of Jonny Wilkinson, whose phenomenal kicking blinded many to his creative talents. Lancaster has Chris Robshaw the Mighty. He also has at his disposal the mercurial genius of Danny Cipriani, who he leaves parked on the bench. There is no reward without risk. There was an awed reaction to my reminiscence earlier this week of how Tottenham’s late, great Dave Mackay refused to believe he had broken his left leg for a second time until he stamped his foot and the jagged white bone stuck out through his sock…then spurned the stretcher and insisted on walking off. So don’t be too surprised if this much loved and revered iron Scot arrives at the funeral on his own two feet.

"Information obtained using torture was used to help foil  an al-Qaeda plot to bring down two planes, it has been claimed. British authorities intercepted a bomb at East Midlands Airport after being 'tipped off' by Saudi Arabian security forces, reportedly following the interrogation by torture of an al-Qaeda operative. The claim comes as former MI5 head Sir John Sawers said torture does produce 'useful information' and can be 'effective in the short term.' Intelligence obtained via torture was reportedly used in a 'Jack Bauer real-time operation' to foil an al-Qaeda plot to bring down two planes and intercept a bomb at East Midlands Airport (pictured) A major security alert was launched after plastic explosives concealed inside inkjet printer cartridges were discovered on two cargo planes travelling from Yemen to the US in October 2010. Pictured is the package found at East Midlands Airport . A major security alert was launched after plastic explosives concealed inside inkjet printer cartridges were discovered on two cargo planes travelling from Yemen to the US in October 2010. It is believed the bombs were designed to go off mid-air and bring the huge planes down over the US. After what was described as a 'tip-off' from Saudi Arabian security forces, the planes were stopped at East Midlands Airport in Leicestershire and the United Arab Emirates and the bombs uncovered. A group called Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) later took responsibility for the plot. Now it has been claimed the discovery at East Midlands Airport was only possible because British officials in Saudi Arabia were in communication with a team believed to have been using torture on a member of terror group al-Qaeda. 'The people in London went back on the phone two or three times to where the interrogation was taking place in Riyadh to find out specifically where the bomb was hidden. There were two Britons there, in immediate communication with where the interrogation was taking place, and as soon as it happened, they were in touch with the UK. It was all done in real time,' an intelligence source told Jamie Merrill, James Hanning, Mark Leftly and Nick Clark at The Independent On Sunday.

It is claimed the discovery at East Midlands Airport was only possible because British officials in Saudi Arabia were in communication with a team believed to have been using torture on a member of al-Qaeda . A source close to the operation said there was 'no way' that the information which led to the plot being exposed 'wasn’t procured under duress', but that the British officials would have ensured they were not present. He added: 'Of course we use intelligence from torture. We take it from wherever we can get it, but we are never, ever going to say ""we don’t want that"". Or ask too many questions about where it has come from. It is the difference between intelligence and evidence.' Last month, following the death of King Abdullah, Prime Minister David Cameron defended Britain's ties with Saudi Arabia - despite the country’s record on human rights. He also said that a piece of counter-terrorism intelligence supplied by the Arab state had 'saved potentially hundreds of lives' in the UK, which aides have confirmed was a reference to the bomb plot. He added: 'Now, you can be Prime Minister and say exactly what you think about every regime in the world and make great headlines, and give great speeches.

And that is the best way I can explain it.' Former spy chief Sir John, who was head of MI6 from 2009 to 2014, yesterday hit back at claims that security services played a role in the radicalisation of British jihadist Mohammed Emwazi. Asim Qureshi, research director of Cage, claims Emwazi, who was nicknamed Jihadi John, was interrogated by MI5 and subjected to security agency harassment before becoming a militant. But Sir John  said arguments that harassment drove Emwazi to join IS were 'very specious'. 'The idea that somehow being spoken to by a member of MI5 is a radicalising act, I think this is very false and very transparent,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Sir John also told presenter Mishal Husain: 'Torture had been used for “thousands of years in order to extract useful information. 'If you decide in 2015 that it doesn't work at all then that would be to misunderstand the problem.' He added: 'The whole problem about torture and maltreatment is sadly is that it does produce intelligence. And that’s why in a civilised society like ours we have to set aside certain methods, even though they might be effective in the short term.

"Beijing (CNN)Native to a remote region of China, this tiny mammal, known as the Ili pika, doesn't know it's a member of an endangered species --  and neither do most people. Rarer -- and some would argue cuter-- than the panda, there are less than 1,000 of these teddy bear-like creatures living in the Tianshan mountain range in the Xinjiang region of northwestern China, says conservationist Li Weidong. Li discovered the pika, formally known as Ochotona iliensis, in 1983 and named it after his hometown, Ili. Last July, Li spotted and photographed the elusive creature for the first time since the early 1990s. He estimates its numbers have declined by almost 70% since its discovery. ""I discovered the species, and I watched as it became endangered,"" he told CNN. ""If it becomes extinct in front of me, I'll feel so guilty."" In 2008, the animal was listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature but there's no official organization or team dedicated studying or protecting it, according to Li. The mammal, only 20 centimeters long, lives on sloping bare rock faces and feeds on grasses at high elevations. Li says the pika's habitat has been affected by global warming. Due to rising temperatures, glaciers have receded and the altitude of permanent snow has risen in the Tianshan mountains, forcing the pikas to gradually retreat to mountain tops, Li said. Ili pikas were originally found at elevations between 3,200 to 3,400 meters, he said. Now they have retreated to elevations of 4,100 meters. ""They have nowhere else to retreat,"" he added. It's also a solitary animal and is not as vocal as other pika species, so if predators are near, Ili pikas are not able to alert each other, Li said. Disease may also be a factor in its decline. In 1983, when Li first came across the mammal, nobody knew what it was. Two years later, Li  found another two and it was declared a new species. In the decade following, Li and his colleagues conducted a number of studies, including a census at 14 different sites. However, in 1992, Li left Ili to work with Xinjiang Academy of Environmental Protection in the regional capital Urumqi. No studies were conducted on Ili pika in the following decade. No one saw the pika, either. In 2002 and 2003, Li,  with a team of volunteers, conducted a fresh census. Despite spending 37 days searching the mountains for the pikas on seven separate trips, they came up empty handed. However, by analyzing droppings and snow tracks, Li, along with Arizona State University biologist Andrew Smith, was able to conclude that the Ili pika population had seen a dramatic decline. Together they calculated that there might be 2,000 mature animals, down from 2,900 in the early 1990s. The research, published in 2005, recommended that the animal should be listed as endangered. In 2007, Li retired early to throw himself into searching for the pika. Last year, he organized a group of 20 volunteers to conduct another survey with infrared cameras. This time, on the second day of the field trip, they finally spotted a pika, who jumped and stepped over Li's feet while he was trying to photograph it. The volunteers dubbed it a ""magic rabbit."" They concluded that there were fewer than 1,000 Ili pikas, said Li. ""This tiny species could be extinct any time,"" he said. ""They don't exist in the sites where they used to be anymore."" Li funds the research with himself, along with donations and occasional grants from organizations like the World Wide Fund for Nature. He says he has spent more than $32,000 of his own money over the past three decades and he has to raise funds to pay for gas. But what upsets Li most isn't the lack of funding. It's the lack of official recognition for the Ili, and other pikas' plight. The Ili pika isn't included on China's List of Wildlife under Special State Protection -- part of the country's 1988 Wildlife Protection Law. The Department for Wildlife and Forest Plants Protection, under the Ministry of Forestry, said it was in the process of updating the list but declined to give any further details. Li and his volunteers have been calling for the establishment of a nature reserve to help protect the animal. ""I'm almost 60, and soon I won't be able to climb the Tianshan Mountains,"" he said. ""So I really hope that an organization will have people study and protect the Ili Pika.""","Lake Anthony (CNN)Native to a remote region of East Davidburgh, this tiny mammal, known as the Ili pika, doesn't know it's a member of an endangered species --  and neither do most people. Rarer -- and some would argue cuter-- than the panda, there are less than 1,000 of these teddy bear-like creatures living in the Ashleymouth mountain range in the Kingfurt region of northwestern East Davidburgh, says conservationist Gabriel Peterson. Gabriel Peterson discovered the pika, formally known as Ochotona iliensis, in 1983 and named it after his hometown, Ili. Last July, Gabriel Peterson spotted and photographed the elusive creature for the first time since the early 1990s. He estimates its numbers have declined by almost 70% since its discovery. ""I discovered the species, and I watched as it became endangered,"" he told CNN. ""If it becomes extinct in front of me, I'll feel so guilty."" In 2008, the animal was listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature but there's no official organization or team dedicated studying or protecting it, according to Gabriel Peterson. The mammal, only 20 centimeters long, lives on sloping bare rock faces and feeds on grasses at high elevations. Gabriel Peterson says the pika's habitat has been affected by global warming. Due to rising temperatures, glaciers have receded and the altitude of permanent snow has risen in the Ashleymouth mountains, forcing the pikas to gradually retreat to mountain tops, Gabriel Peterson said. Ili pikas were originally found at elevations between 3,200 to 3,400 meters, he said. Now they have retreated to elevations of 4,100 meters. ""They have nowhere else to retreat,"" he added. It's also a solitary animal and is not as vocal as other pika species, so if predators are near, Ili pikas are not able to alert each other, Gabriel Peterson said. Disease may also be a factor in its decline. In 1983, when Gabriel Peterson first came across the mammal, nobody knew what it was. Two years later, Gabriel Peterson  found another two and it was declared a new species. In the decade following, Gabriel Peterson and his colleagues conducted a number of studies, including a census at 14 different sites. However, in 1992, Gabriel Peterson left Ili to work with Kingfurt Academy of Environmental Protection in the regional capital Priscillaborough. No studies were conducted on Ili pika in the following decade. No one saw the pika, either. In 2002 and 2003, Gabriel Peterson,  with a team of volunteers, conducted a fresh census. Despite spending 37 days searching the mountains for the pikas on seven separate trips, they came up empty handed. However, by analyzing droppings and snow tracks, Gabriel Peterson, along with Arizona State University biologist David Sanders, was able to conclude that the Ili pika population had seen a dramatic decline. Together they calculated that there might be 2,000 mature animals, down from 2,900 in the early 1990s. The research, published in 2005, recommended that the animal should be listed as endangered. In 2007, Gabriel Peterson retired early to throw himself into searching for the pika. Last year, he organized a group of 20 volunteers to conduct another survey with infrared cameras. This time, on the second day of the field trip, they finally spotted a pika, who jumped and stepped over Gabriel Peterson's feet while he was trying to photograph it. The volunteers dubbed it a ""magic rabbit."" They concluded that there were fewer than 1,000 Ili pikas, said Gabriel Peterson. ""This tiny species could be extinct any time,"" he said. ""They don't exist in the sites where they used to be anymore."" Gabriel Peterson funds the research with himself, along with donations and occasional grants from organizations like the World Wide Fund for Nature. He says he has spent more than $32,000 of his own money over the past three decades and he has to raise funds to pay for gas. But what upsets Gabriel Peterson most isn't the lack of funding. It's the lack of official recognition for the Ili, and other pikas' plight. The Ili pika isn't included on East Davidburgh's Gabriel Petersonst of Wildlife under Special State Protection -- part of the country's 1988 Wildlife Protection Law.

"New Zealand is conducting mass spying on its South Pacific neighbours then passing the information to a US-led intelligence alliance, media reports citing leaked documents said Thursday. New Zealand snoops on the phone calls, emails, Internet browsing sessions and online chats of government ministers and senior officials in Pacific island nations, including French territories in the region, the New Zealand Herald reported. Western interest in the South Pacific has risen in recent years as China increases aid and diplomatic activities in a region that New Zealand and Australia traditionally regard as their sphere of influence. Scroll down for video . Leaked documents supplied by Edward Snowden reportedly showed the extent of New Zealand's spying . New Zealand Prime Minister John Key(left) refused to offer comment on the specifics of the allegations but said intelligence services had broken no laws, while Tongan Prime Minister 'Akilisi Pohiva (right) claims such a programme would be a 'breach of trust' The newspaper said documents supplied by US whistleblower Edward Snowden showed the extent of New Zealand's spying on behalf of the 'Five Eyes' intelligence network, which also includes the United States, Britain, Australia and Canada. 'In effect, the New Zealand spy agency gathers information on the country's nearest neighbours to help secure its place in the US-led alliance,' the New Zealand Herald said after conducting a joint investigation into the leaks with US-based website The Intercept. Separately, the Sydney Morning Herald said the documents also revealed New Zealand and Australian intelligence services worked together to spy on Indonesia's largest mobile phone network Telkomsel. The Intercept said New Zealand's Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) used its Waihopai base in the country's South Island to collect vast amounts of data from the region, most of it from friendly nations. New Zealand is conducting mass spying on its South Pacific neighbours then passing the information to a US-led intelligence alliance, media reports say citing leaked documents . It said the base was upgraded to 'full take' operations in 2009, meaning it collects both the content and metadata of all communications, rather than targeting specific individuals or agencies. Nations reportedly subjected to New Zealand's wholesale snooping included Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, the Solomons Islands, the Cook Islands, Kiribati, Vanuatu, Nauru and France's overseas territories New Caledonia and French Polynesia. 'Five Eyes', also known as 'FVEY', is an intelligence alliance. The five nations that make up the world's leading intelligence-sharing network include the United States, Australia, Canada, Britain and New Zealand. The countries that comprise the group divide the world into eavesdropping target sectors and share the results. Tongan Prime Minister 'Akilisi Pohiva reportedly told Fairfax Media that such a programme would be a 'breach of trust' but added 'it is happening all over the world'. 'Tonga is too small to stand up to the alleged spying. China is on the radar... so what can we do?' he said.

New Zealand Prime Minister John Key refused to comment on the specifics of the allegations but said intelligence services had broken no laws.

'There are also things I said and places where I was that are attributed to other people.’ He said that Brooke did confess to him that she was a prostitute and he is astonished at the suggestion that she was not. ‘She told me she was a prostitute and I believe that,’ Nick says. ‘Of course, I have no proof one way or another, because obviously I wasn’t there when she did it and I never lived with her. 'But she didn’t throw money around, not that I could see – she wasn’t exactly turning up at the pub in a Bentley.’ Nick, who has had no contact with Brooke for six years, said he believes the books are fiction with  a basis in reality. ‘Characters in the book are based on people.

"These incredible pictures show the ancient art of falconry as it is still practiced in the harsh mountainous region that straddles the border between Russia, China and Kazakhstan. The traditional hunting method is a prominent part of the culture in the autonomous Xinjiang Uygur region, where falconers gather every year to compete in a place known as the 'Village of the Falcon'. As a means to preserve the skill for future generations, the local government has also begun issuing monthly salaries of 300 - 500 yuan to falcon masters to encourage them to pass down their skills. Scroll down for video . A falconer holds his hunting eagle aloft during the annual festival held in the remote mountainous region of Xinjiang Uygur, China . Members of the Uygur, Kazak and Kirgiz ethnic groups have practiced the ancient tradition for generations . Every year falconers gather to compete in Akqi county, of Kezilesu Kirgiz autonomous prefecture, northwest China . A falconer holds his eagle prior to the beginning of the festival where participants compete in a range of competitions designed to test the ability of their hunting eagle . Hunters wear traditional costumes, complete with fur coats made of marmot, fox or wolf skins which have been caught by their eagles . Since November 2010, falconry - which is predominately practiced by the Uygur, Kazak and Kirgiz ethnic groups - has been listed by UNESCO as an intangible cultural heritage of humanity. The training and handling of the large birds of prey follows a strict set of ancient rules that local eagle hunters are attempting to preserve. The tradition of hunting with the huge eagles is said to have been started by the nomadic Khitans from Manchuria in northern China around 940AD. The eagles soar through the air at speeds of up to 200mph as they race to reach their keeper first, during annual festivals. Their hunting prowess is also tested as they chase meat pulled along by the horses. Other activities held during the competition include horse racing, archery and Bushkashi, which is a goatskin tug of war on horseback.

The traditional hunting method is a prominent part of the culture in the autonomous Erinton Lydiaport region, where falconers gather every year to compete in a place known as North Emmaside. As a means to preserve the skill for future generations, the local government has also begun issuing monthly salaries of 300 - 500 yuan to falcon masters to encourage them to pass down their skills.

Every year falconers gather to compete in Courtney Williams county, of Kezilesu Emily Kim autonomous prefecture, northwest Lake Sarah . A falconer holds his eagle prior to the beginning of the festival where participants compete in a range of competitions designed to test the ability of their hunting eagle . Hunters wear traditional costumes, complete with fur coats made of marmot, fox or wolf skins which have been caught by their eagles . Since November 2010, falconry - which is predominately practiced by the Lydiaport, New Rachelport and Emily Kim ethnic groups - has been listed by UNESCO as an intangible cultural heritage of humanity. The training and handling of the large birds of prey follows a strict set of ancient rules that local eagle hunters are attempting to preserve. The tradition of hunting with the huge eagles is said to have been started by the nomadic Khitans from Frostside in northern Lake Sarah around 940AD. The eagles soar through the air at speeds of up to 200mph as they race to reach their keeper first, during annual festivals. Their hunting prowess is also tested as they chase meat pulled along by the horses. Other activities held during the competition include horse racing, archery and Susan Rodriguez, which is a goatskin tug of war on horseback.

"England’s experiment of having two coaches fell apart when tension arose between Andy Flower and Ashley Giles over the need to rest the best players from one-day matches.

"An unruly wind swirled around Haifa on Friday, whipping the palm trees and sending sand on the beach by the Mediterranean flying. It seemed a fittingly uncomfortable Middle Eastern welcome for Wales ahead of what promises to be a match of feverish tenor and great significance. Here in the Holy Land, Wales want to take a step closer to their long-sought grail: qualification for a major tournament. Not since the 1958 World Cup have they been to a finals competition. Wales midfielder Gareth Bale stretches during a training session in Israel on Friday . WALES (probable, 5-3-1-1): Hennessey; Gunter, Collins, Williams, Davies, Taylor; Ramsey, Allen, Ledley; Bale; Vokes. ISRAEL (probable, 4-3-3): Marciano; Dgani, Ben Haim I, Tibi, Ben Harush; Yeini, Natcho, Refaelov; Ben Haim II, Zahavi, Damari. Israel host Chris Coleman’s team in an encounter that could go some way to defining both sides’ aspirations of reaching Euro 2016. It is first against second in Group B. Coleman took his players through their final paces in the freshly-built Sammy Ofer Stadium, which will this evening be filled with around 30,000 fanatical Israel supporters, as well as 900 from Wales. Those travelling fans have not seen their side beaten in this campaign, two wins and two draws, the last point in Belgium a hugely encouraging display and result. Israel have three wins from three, and beat Bosnia 3-0 in their last home game. Bale holds off his team-mates in training as Wales hope to maintain their unbeaten start in Group B . This is an opportunity that needs to be seized by Wales, though. Victory would crystalise the promise shown so far and catapult the finals in France nearer into view. Defeat would undermine that promise to the same extent. Coleman is aware of the importance of this tie, calling it Wales’ biggest since the Euro 2004 play-off against Russia. He hopes to be saying the same when Belgium come to Cardiff in June, but that can only be the case with a positive result here. The Wales manager has twice been involved in campaigns that came close but failed, at either end of his Wales playing career. In 1993 a missed spot-kick against Romania proved decisive, in 2003 it was an inability to score past Russia over two legs. Coleman spoke passionately of these memories as he explained his mentality heading into this crucial game. ‘I was part of a couple of great Welsh sides that never did it,’ he said. ‘I enjoyed the excitement but the disappointment lasts forever. Wales captain Ashley Williams (left) shares a joke with Gareth Bale (right) in training on Friday . ‘We have a good current group, we are going in the right direction but we have been here before. One foot in the door does not get you there. I do not want to play things down, we have earned this pressure and this is what it is all about. But we have to continue to work hard to get to where we want to go.’ His opposition manager Eli Guttman was in jovial mood, making sarcastic remarks about calling Cristiano Ronaldo for advice and insisting Gareth Bale must be worth his £86million fee because Real Madrid paid it. Coleman struck a different chord. ‘I feel focused,’ he said. ‘I am looking forward to it. We have had a real good week of preparation. I am nervous, excited. Any manager who says he is relaxed is telling you a lie. ‘All we can do is focus on performance and the plan. That has been the secret of our success so far.’ Having Bale in your midst must provide a comfort blanket, even amid extreme criticism of his form emanating from Madrid. The 25-year-old loves playing for his country, where he is among long-term friends. No-one belts out the national anthem louder. Wales boss Chris Coleman is adamant his side can cope with a hostile atmosphere in Haifa on Saturday . He has not scored in three internationals, but dragged Wales to victory in Andorra in the opening game of this campaign to set the tone, scoring a retaken free-kick nine minutes from time. Bale is likely to start in a free role behind the striker with a 5-3-2 formation mooted. But Israel will start right back Orel Dgani for the first time and Coleman said he would explore Bale’s position as the match took shape. ‘If there is a weakness to be exploited then of course you look at it,’ he said. ‘We’ve changed tactically during a match before.’ It is not all about Bale. Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen and captain Ashley Williams are elite players operating in the Premier League. Williams will win his 50th cap. There is youth, but experience. Coleman acknowledged Israel’s potency in attack, with RB Leipzig’s Omer Damari leading the line looking to add to his five goals in qualification, level with Danny Welbeck. No player has more. Tal Ben Haim, once of Chelsea, Manchester City and Bolton, is the most recognisable name in Israel’s line-up. He wears the armband and is predicting an even louder noise at the Sammy Ofer than the one that stunned Bosnia. ‘I know British football but it will not make it easier for me,’ he said. ‘In the last game all the players spoke about the crowd and we expect against Wales the atmosphere will be even better.’","An unruly wind swirled around Port Timothy on Friday, whipping the palm trees and sending sand on the beach by the Mikefurt flying.

"Controversial: Hertz installed the cameras as part of the in-car NeverLost app in 2014 . Car rental company Hertz has been slammed by customers for putting cameras inside their vehicles. The controversial device was installed as part of the in-car navigation system and guide, NeverLost 6 app, which was introduced in 2014. Drivers fear the lens is a breach of their privacy, but the firm insist they do not work and have no plans to turn them on. They also state they do not have the bandwidth capabilities to support video streaming. The cameras were added so drivers could interact with a member of the customer services team during an emergency or when stationary. To start a conversation, the motorist or a passenger would have been able to turn on the camera themselves - but because of technical difficulties the feature hasn't been integrated into the system. Rich Broome, a spokesman for Hertz, told the Daily Mail Online it would have been completely customer activated and could not have been turned on remotely. He added that there is 'nothing behind the lens' and there is no timetable to connect the device. However some drivers who regularly rent from Hertz have still expressed their concern at the camera's presence. One customer wrote on the forum Flyertalk: 'I am a regular renter from Hertz (President's Circle). This week after the usual excessive wait for the Hertz airport shuttle, I got into a rental car at O'Hare airport. 'I immediately noticed the new NeverLost and I was completely shocked to see a camera built into the device looking at me. The system can't be turned off from what could tell. Further investigation revealed that the camera can see the entire inside of the car. 'I know rental car companies have been tracking the speed and movements of their vehicles for years but putting a camera inside the cabin of the vehicle is taking their need for information a little too far. Breach of privacy? Some drivers have expressed their concern at the presence of the device, but the hire car firm said there is 'nothing behind the lens' and the camera simply doesn't work . 'I find this to be completely unacceptable In fact, if I get another car from Hertz with a camera in it, I will move our business from Hertz completely. I influence car rentals of many others and I don't think anyone would want to be on camera while they are driving around or sitting at a red light. 'Given what Hertz has invested in this system, I wonder how much consumer pressure will make them to pull the plug on this. Business is built one customer at a time and they will no longer have me as a customer.' The company told a Twitter user who criticized the use of the lens: 'The camera in the NeverLost device was never activated as we do not have adequate bandwidth capabilities to the car to support streaming video at this time.' Mr Broome added that if any customer has any concerns with the device, they can simply switch to another car. Only 20 per cent of the cars have a camera inside. It is not the first time in-car recording technology has caused a stir. Last year Chevrolette released a new Corvette with a 'nanny cam' inside - aimed at keeping an eye on suspicious valets. But General Motors were forced to send an advisory to customers warning them not to use the product as it is illegal in some states.","Controversial: Hertz installed the cameras as part of the in-car NeverLost app in 2014 .

'I find this to be completely unacceptable In fact, if I get another car from Hertz with a camera in it, I will move our business from Hertz completely. I influence car rentals of many others and I don't think anyone would want to be on camera while they are driving around or sitting at a red light. 'Given what Hertz has invested in this system, I wonder how much consumer pressure will make them to pull the plug on this. Business is built one customer at a time and they will no longer have me as a customer.' The company told a Twitter user who criticized the use of the lens: 'The camera in the NeverLost device was never activated as we do not have adequate bandwidth capabilities to the car to support streaming video at this time.' Mr Elizabeth Parker added that if any customer has any concerns with the device, they can simply switch to another car. Only 20 per cent of the cars have a camera inside. It is not the first time in-car recording technology has caused a stir. Last year Chevrolette released a new Corvette with a 'nanny cam' inside - aimed at keeping an eye on suspicious valets. But General Motors were forced to send an advisory to customers warning them not to use the product as it is illegal in some states."
"Arrested: Gina Louise Causey has been arrested for a false rape claim against a fictitious police officer . A Louisiana woman has been arrested after falsely claiming she was raped to hide from her husband the fact she had fallen pregnant through an extramarital affair say police.

Her attacker then made her lie on the floor of his car and drove for 'only a minute or so' to a nearby house where he took her inside and raped her. Causey then said the fictitious rapist demanded she hand over her driver's license and he took a picture. He then put it into a box 'wtih several other women's driver's licenses' and told her if she went to the police he would know according to NOLA.com .

Beginning March 27, and running through September 13, underwater enthusiasts will be able to get up close and personal with some spectacular seascapes - without ever having to don a wetsuit. The exhibit, Coral Reefs: Secret Cities of the Sea, will feature a live coral reef, a 360-degree immersive virtual dive experience and specimens of over 200 types of coral, fish and fossils, some of which have never been seen before. Scroll down for video . Beginning March 27, London's Natural History Museum will open a new exhibit called Coral Reefs: Secret Cities of the Sea . Coral reefs are primarily found in the shallow waters of the tropics and are home to almost a quarter of all living species in the sea. But they offer many more benefits than simply being beautiful. The reefs also home to ample fishing, tourism and even storm protection opportunities, and are estimated to be worth more than £200 billion each year.

"The allegations were as vindictive and damaging as they were utterly false. Yet they all but destroyed primary school teacher Brendan O’Brien. Brendan, 45, had for 16 years been an exemplary teacher: popular with pupils and respected by colleagues. Yet in just a year his reputation was shattered, he lost his job and became clinically depressed, prey to anxiety and panic. Brendan O'Brien (pictured with his wife, Jane) had 18 charges made against him concerning child abuse . A £25,000 legal bill exhausted his entire savings and ate into those of his parents. His reputation unjustly besmirched, he and his wife Jane — who has two grown-up daughters by a previous relationship — had to give up their dream of adopting a child. And this awful ordeal was caused by five boy pupils from his West Yorkshire primary school who accused him of sexual abuse. It’s the worst accusation that could be levied against a teacher. And in today’s climate, where historic cases of the abuse of children are as prolific as they are disturbing, the police, quite rightly, had to act. Yet the most cursory of checks would have revealed that his accusers were troublemakers: disruptive, aggressive, defiant and precociously sexualised. But once the boys — present and past pupils aged ten to 12 — had made the allegations that their teacher had inappropriately touched them and instigated sexual activity, the machinery of the law was set in motion. And despite the complete absence of evidence, it would destroy the name of a good man in the process. In January, a year after Brendan was first arrested, a jury at Leeds Crown Court acquitted him, swiftly and unanimously, on all charges. He had pleaded not guilty to 17 counts of sexual assault on a male child under the age of 13 and one count of causing or inciting a male child under 13 to engage in sexual activity. Brendan and Jane's (pictured) lives were destroyed when the allegations against Brian were made . So how could Brendan be left with a life in tatters while five malicious trouble-makers are carrying on with their lives, without so much as a telling off? These are questions Brendan and Jane, 43, a reflexologist and sales assistant, are asking themselves. Brendan says: ‘When I was charged, I was no longer Mr O’Brien, a respected village primary school teacher. Instead, I was a pariah. I was too scared to leave the house. I became introverted, and I lost 2 st. Yet the boys who accused me have been able to hide behind a curtain of anonymity while my name was publicised. ‘My accusers should be punished for making false and damaging claims against me. But they are all carrying on as though nothing has happened while I have to piece together my shattered life.’ Shattered is the correct word: Brendan’s teaching contract was terminated in July. ‘I don’t know if I can ever face standing in a classroom of pupils, wondering if one of them is about to make a complaint,’ he says. Brendan’s nightmare began in January last year. He had driven to school and by 6.45am was sitting at his desk, planning his lessons. One matter was preying on his mind: how to deal with a particularly disruptive pupil. Brendan had already spoken about him to the school’s headteacher. The day before, he had called the ten-year-old’s mother, inviting her to school to discuss her son’s behaviour. It was getting virtually impossible to teach with him interrupting, shouting wisecracks and refusing to do any work. Then an hour later, he was summoned to his head’s office. Facing him were two police officers. ‘I was told I was being arrested on suspicion of sexual assault on a minor,’ he recalls. ‘And the child making the accusations was the same pupil causing problems. Brendan (pictured) had, for 16 years, been an exemplary teacher: popular with pupils and respected by colleagues . ‘I was completely, utterly dumbfounded. But my first thought was: “This will all be dismissed when the police investigate it and realise there is absolutely no foundation in it at all.” ’ But in the space of 12 months his life would be thrown into tumult as 18 charges were made against him concerning the children, the first boy and four others the ten-year-old knew. On that January day, Brendan spent nine hours in police custody where every aspect of his teaching style was scrutinised. He had, on his own admission, a tactile approach. He explains: ‘I would often praise children by giving them a pat on the back or a tap on the knee. I’d never questioned that it was inappropriate. But this boy claimed I had touched him in a sexual manner.’ Child sexual abuse costs the UK an estimated £3.2 billion a year because of social care, health problems and legal bills . Jane, his wife of ten years, was by now dealing with her own shock. Two-and-a-half hours after her husband was arrested, two officers arrived at their four-bedroom terrace house in Barnsley. Jane recalls: ‘My initial thought was that Brendan had been in an accident. I asked if he was dead. ‘But when they said he had been arrested for sexual assault, I was floored. The officers had come to search our home for possible evidence and to seize electronic equipment. ‘My legs would hardly hold me up as the police rooted through our bedroom. It was horribly intrusive. Although I knew Brendan had done nothing wrong, I felt as though we were criminals. ‘They looked through my work files and took away our iPad, mobiles, a Kindle and memory sticks. They spent months examining them, but didn’t find a single suspicious thing.’ When Brendan arrived home at 6.30pm, he was exhausted and bewildered. Jane says: ‘He could barely speak. But I never once doubted his innocence. The claim was ludicrous.’ Both he and Jane were confident a short investigation would swiftly exonerate him. They told only close friends and family of the accusations. Jane (pictured) says: ‘I never once doubted his innocence. The claim was ludicrous.' But the nightmare escalated. Last March, Brendan was arrested again. A further four ex-pupils who knew one another in some way claimed he had inappropriately touched them and instigated sexual activity. ‘I had no idea why they would make up such malicious and despicable lies,’ he recalls. In April, he was formally charged with the sexual assaults against five boys: a ten-year-old current pupil; three 11-year-olds and a 12-year-old. But their stories were inconsistent. Some attested the assaults took place while he was teaching, others said it was while he was alone in his classroom talking one-to-one with them. And evidence read out in court supported the fact that each of the accusers was a known troublemaker. The youngest had boasted he would ‘get Mr O’Brien fired’. One of the 11-year-olds had grabbed another boy’s genitals, exposed himself and pinned down a female pupil until she cried. Even his own mother admitted in a meeting at his school, after Brendan’s arrest, she’d seen nothing in her son’s behaviour to indicate he had been abused. Jane recalls the fallout of the allegations. ‘Brendan had always been so full of life and very jovial, but overnight his character changed.’ Her husband — a caring step-father to her two daughters — barely spoke and became consumed by fear. He suffered from anxiety and tremors, and his GP prescribed antidepressants. ‘I felt utterly useless,’ says Jane. ‘But I had to be the strong one.’ Brendan endured further distress when a local radio station misinterpreted the charges against him and broadcast that he’d had sex with young boys. And the case brought one devastating side-effect. Brendan and Jane — whose daughters are 19 and 22 — had long dreamt of having a child of their own. Jane had, however, suffered from fertility problems, and they had enquired about adoption. ‘But with abuse charges hanging over Brendan, we would never be considered,’ says Jane. The legal proceedings consumed their savings, and Brendan’s parents — in no doubt of their son’s innocence — chipped in. Brendan (pictured) says he became consumed by fear and was prescribed antidepressants for his anxiety and tremors . As the case approached, a swell of support buoyed them up. Brendan recalls: ‘Parents of ex-pupils would stop me in the street and give me a hug, all of them telling me they didn’t believe a word of the claims. ‘But I still felt terrified. My solicitor had warned me if I was found guilty I faced up to seven years in prison and my name would be tarnished for ever. Mercifully, the jury took just an hour to dismiss each of the charges against Brendan. Jane was with her daughters in court and when the verdict came, she was euphoric. ‘I squeezed my daughters’ hands,’ she recalls. ‘I just wanted to run to Brendan and hug him.’ Justice had prevailed, but at what cost? ‘I don’t know whether I will ever completely recover,’ says Brendan. ‘Everyone who knew us supported me, but there will always be strangers who believe there’s no smoke without fire.’ Jane adds: ‘I can never forgive Brendan’s accusers. I truly believe the youngest of them was acting in revenge, and then the other boys joined a nasty, ill-conceived vendetta to try to destroy him. ‘And if this is what teachers face — and we are told that false sexual accusations against them are not uncommon — the whole profession must feel under threat. ‘And one thing is certain: I don’t want Brendan to return to a classroom ever again.’","The allegations were as vindictive and damaging as they were utterly false. Yet they all but destroyed primary school teacher Zachary Williams. Zachary Williams, 45, had for 16 years been an exemplary teacher: popular with pupils and respected by colleagues. Yet in just a year his reputation was shattered, he lost his job and became clinically depressed, prey to anxiety and panic. Zachary Williams Jose Nicholson (pictured with his wife, Sandra Wilson) had 18 charges made against him concerning child abuse . A £25,000 legal bill exhausted his entire savings and ate into those of his parents. His reputation unjustly besmirched, he and his wife Sandra Wilson — who has two grown-up daughters by a previous relationship — had to give up their dream of adopting a child. And this awful ordeal was caused by five boy pupils from his Brendaborough primary school who accused him of sexual abuse. It’s the worst accusation that could be levied against a teacher. And in today’s climate, where historic cases of the abuse of children are as prolific as they are disturbing, the police, quite rightly, had to act. Yet the most cursory of checks would have revealed that his accusers were troublemakers: disruptive, aggressive, defiant and precociously sexualised. But once the boys — present and past pupils aged ten to 12 — had made the allegations that their teacher had inappropriately touched them and instigated sexual activity, the machinery of the law was set in motion. And despite the complete absence of evidence, it would destroy the name of a good man in the process. In January, a year after Zachary Williams was first arrested, a jury at Leeds Crown Court acquitted him, swiftly and unanimously, on all charges. He had pleaded not guilty to 17 counts of sexual assault on a male child under the age of 13 and one count of causing or inciting a male child under 13 to engage in sexual activity. Zachary Williams and Sandra Wilson's (pictured) lives were destroyed when the allegations against Cindy Richards were made . So how could Zachary Williams be left with a life in tatters while five malicious trouble-makers are carrying on with their lives, without so much as a telling off? These are questions Zachary Williams and Sandra Wilson, 43, a reflexologist and sales assistant, are asking themselves. Zachary Williams says: ‘When I was charged, I was no longer Mr Zachary Williams, a respected village primary school teacher. Instead, I was a pariah. I was too scared to leave the house. I became introverted, and I lost 2 st. Yet the boys who accused me have been able to hide behind a curtain of anonymity while my name was publicised. ‘My accusers should be punished for making false and damaging claims against me. But they are all carrying on as though nothing has happened while I have to piece together my shattered life.’ Shattered is the correct word: Zachary Williams’s teaching contract was terminated in July. ‘I don’t know if I can ever face standing in a classroom of pupils, wondering if one of them is about to make a complaint,’ he says. Zachary Williams’s nightmare began in January last year. He had driven to school and by 6.45am was sitting at his desk, planning his lessons. One matter was preying on his mind: how to deal with a particularly disruptive pupil. Zachary Williams had already spoken about him to the school’s headteacher. The day before, he had called the ten-year-old’s mother, inviting her to school to discuss her son’s behaviour. It was getting virtually impossible to teach with him interrupting, shouting wisecracks and refusing to do any work. Then an hour later, he was summoned to his head’s office. Facing him were two police officers. ‘I was told I was being arrested on suspicion of sexual assault on a minor,’ he recalls. ‘And the child making the accusations was the same pupil causing problems. Zachary Williams (pictured) had, for 16 years, been an exemplary teacher: popular with pupils and respected by colleagues . ‘I was completely, utterly dumbfounded. But my first thought was: “This will all be dismissed when the police investigate it and realise there is absolutely no foundation in it at all.” ’ But in the space of 12 months his life would be thrown into tumult as 18 charges were made against him concerning the children, the first boy and four others the ten-year-old knew. On that January day, Zachary Williams spent nine hours in police custody where every aspect of his teaching style was scrutinised. He had, on his own admission, a tactile approach. He explains: ‘I would often praise children by giving them a pat on the back or a tap on the knee. I’d never questioned that it was inappropriate. But this boy claimed I had touched him in a sexual manner.’ Child sexual abuse costs the Denisestad an estimated £3.2 billion a year because of social care, health problems and legal bills . Sandra Wilson, his wife of ten years, was by now dealing with her own shock. Two-and-a-half hours after her husband was arrested, two officers arrived at their four-bedroom terrace house in Garystad. Sandra Wilson recalls: ‘My initial thought was that Zachary Williams had been in an accident. I asked if he was dead. ‘But when they said he had been arrested for sexual assault, I was floored. The officers had come to search our home for possible evidence and to seize electronic equipment. ‘My legs would hardly hold me up as the police rooted through our bedroom. It was horribly intrusive.

"John Moore has been awarded £400 after being put up in a Club 18-30 hotel by Thomas Cook . A Parish councillor  has won a £400 payout from Thomas Cook after booking what he thought was a 'relaxing holiday' to a Greek party island where he was housed with 'boozed up' youngsters at a Club 18-30 hotel. John Moore, 56, from Herne in Kent, planned to spend a week on the island of Zante with his partner Angela, 51, in September. Rather than the peaceful break they were hoping for, the couple, who run a sweet shop in Herne Bay, Kent,  were booked into Christina Studios in the resort of Laganas in Zante, advertised as an 18-30 clubbing destination. After spending two nights in the hotel where youngsters were 'banging on the walls and screaming and shouting', the couple abandoned the package holiday for something more quiet. They have since been awarded £400 in compensation by the holiday company. While being advertised by Club 18-30, Christina Studios is described on the Thomas Cook website as 'one of the best chill-out zones' in Zante. Upon their arrival however Mr Moore found 'boozed up' youngsters who 'didn't seem to sleep'. 'When we got there I asked the rep if he really thought I would book an 18-30 holiday,' the Parish councillor said. 'When I go on holiday I don't care really where it is, I want to just have a good time but it wasn't made obvious to me that it was a holiday for young people. 'It was an official 18-30 resort. It was packed with youngsters banging on the walls and screaming and shouting, so we decided to find somewhere else more to our liking.' After complaining to the Thomas Cook rep at the resort, the couple were told in order to be relocated they would have to pay extra on top of the £600 they had already spent. They would also have no other choice but to go to another Club 18-30, said Mr Moore. 'We were just speechless really, it wasn't what we wanted or what we were expecting and Angela was horrified.' While the couple were dismayed at having to share their accommodation with 'rowdy' youngsters, they were least impressed with the owner of the hotel's treatment towards them. 'The apartments didn't have hot water but when I complained the owner used very, very rude language.' At that Mr Moore and his partner packed their things immediately and, they say, waited outside the hotel for their rep to find them new accommodation. Eventually they decided to find themselves somewhere else to stay and filed a complaint with the company upon their return to the UK. Mr Moore decided to launch legal action when they failed to act, and was recently offered £400 after requesting a summons from a judge. The hotel where Mr Moore and his partner stayed was advertised as being 600m from the Laganas strip (above), hailed as one of Zante's biggest nightlife spots . The 56-year-old Parish councillor said Christina Studios (above) where he was placed was 'packed with youngsters' who 'screamed and banged on walls' 'I'm not surprised at all (that they've offered me money), they didn't have a leg to stand on,' he said, speaking of the offer. 'They sent us to an 18-30s hotel having seen how old we looked.' Among reviews of the apartments online is one which warns: 'Don't bother if you are over thirty as it's too noisy.' The apartments are a five minute walk from the Laganas strip, described by Thomas Cook as Zante's 'party resort' whose nightlife is 'in the same league as Ibiza'. But Mr Moore claims he was sold a relaxing holiday, with the resort also described as suitable for family trips. Among TripAdvisor reviews of the hotel are some which describe it as 'filthy' and 'noisy'. One positive comment was left by a young woman who described it as the 'ultimate' place for a boys or girls' holiday. Thomas Cook apologised for the couple's experience in September. 'We would like to apologise to Mr Moore for any inconvenience he may have experienced while staying at the Christina Studios in Zante with our Escapades brand in September 2014,' a spokesman said. 'It is never our intention to disappoint our customers and we are happy to say this matter has now been resolved to his satisfaction.'

"Hillary Clinton, pictured in 2012. The presumptive presidential candidate for the Democrats, used a personal email account when Secretary of State, rather than a government-issued email address . The computer server that transmitted and received Hillary Clinton's emails - on a private account she used exclusively for official business when she was Secretary of State - traced back to an Internet service-registered to her family's home in Chappaqua, New York, according to records reviewed. The highly unusual practice of a Cabinet-level official physically running her own email would have given Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, impressive control over limiting access to her message archives. It also would distinguish Clinton's secretive email practices as far more sophisticated than some politicians, including Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin, who were caught conducting official business using free email services operated by Microsoft Corp. and Yahoo Inc. Most Internet users rely on professional outside companies, such as Google Inc. or their own employers, for the behind-the-scenes complexities of managing their email communications. Government employees generally use servers run by federal agencies where they work. In most cases, individuals who operate their own email servers are technical experts or users so concerned about issues of privacy and surveillance they take matters into their own hands. Clinton has not described her motivation for using a private email account - hdr22@clintonemail.com - which traced back to her own private email server registered under an apparent pseudonym - for official State Department business. Operating her own server would have afforded Clinton additional legal opportunities to block government or private subpoenas in criminal, administrative or civil cases because her lawyers could object in court before being forced to turn over any emails. And since the Secret Service was guarding Clinton's home, an email server there would have been well protected from theft or a physical hacking. But homebrew email servers are generally not as reliable, secure from hackers or protected from fires or floods as those in commercial data centers. Those professional facilities provide monitoring for viruses or hacking attempts, regulated temperatures, off-site backups, generators in case of power outages, fire-suppression systems and redundant communications lines. Scroll down for video . The Clintons' home in Chappaqua, upstate New York.  Hillary Clinton's emails - on a private account she used exclusively for official business when she was Secretary of State - traced back to an Internet service-registered to the family's home . A spokesman for Clinton did not respond to requests seeking comment on Tuesday. Clinton ignored the issue during a speech on Tuesday night at the 30th anniversary gala of EMILY's List, which works to elect Democratic women who support abortion rights. It was unclear whom Clinton hired to set up or maintain her private email server, which the AP traced to a mysterious identity, Eric Hoteham. That name does not appear in public records databases, campaign contribution records or Internet background searches. Hoteham was listed as the customer at Clinton's $1.7 million home on Old House Lane in Chappaqua in records registering the Internet address for her email server since August 2010. The Hoteham personality also is associated with a separate email server, presidentclinton.com, and a non-functioning website, wjcoffice.com, all linked to the same residential Internet account as Mrs. Clinton's email server. The former president's full name is William Jefferson Clinton. In November 2012, without explanation, Clinton's private email account was reconfigured to use Google's servers as a backup in case her own personal email server failed, according to Internet records. That is significant because Clinton publicly supported Google's accusations in June 2011 that China's government had tried to break into the Google mail accounts of senior U.S. government officials. It was one of the first instances of a major American corporation openly accusing a foreign government of hacking. Then, in July 2013, five months after she resigned as Secretary of State, Clinton's private email server was reconfigured again to use a Denver-based commercial email provider, MX Logic, which is now owned by McAfee Inc., a top Internet security company. The New York Times reported on Monday that Clinton exclusively used a personal email account it did not specify to conduct State Department business. The disclosure raised questions about whether she took actions to preserve copies of her old work-related emails, as required by the Federal Records Act. A Clinton spokesman, Nick Merrill, told the newspaper that Clinton complied with the letter and spirit of the law because her advisers reviewed tens of thousands of pages of her personal emails to decide which ones to turn over to the State Department after the agency asked for them. In theory but not in practice, Clinton's official emails would be accessible to anyone who requested copies under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. Under the law, citizens and foreigners can compel the government to turn over copies of federal records for zero or little cost. Since Clinton effectively retained control over emails in her private account even after she resigned in 2013, the government would have to negotiate with Clinton to turn over messages it can't already retrieve from the inboxes of federal employees she emailed. The AP has waited more than a year under the open records law for the State Department to turn over some emails covering Clinton's tenure as the nation's top diplomat, although the agency has never suggested that it didn't possess all her emails. Clinton's private email account surfaced publicly in March 2013 after a convicted Romanian hacker known as Guccifer published emails stolen from former White House adviser Sidney Blumenthal. The Internet domain was registered around the time of her secretary of state nomination. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., chairman of the special House committee investigating the Benghazi attacks, said the committee learned last summer - when agency documents were turned over to the committee - that Clinton had used a private email account while secretary of state. More recently the committee learned that she used private email accounts exclusively and had more than one, Gowdy said. President Obama signed a bill last year that bans the use of private email accounts by government officials unless they retain copies of messages in their official account or forward copies to their government accounts within 20 days. The bill did not become law until more than one year after Clinton left the State Department.","Kristin Lane, pictured in 2012. The presumptive presidential candidate for the Democrats, used a personal email account when Secretary of State, rather than a government-issued email address . The computer server that transmitted and received Kristin Lane's emails - on a private account she used exclusively for official business when she was Secretary of State - traced back to an Internet service-registered to her family's home in Acostaland, Port Jimmyfurt, according to records reviewed. The highly unusual practice of a Cabinet-level official physically running her own email would have given Kristin Lane, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, impressive control over limiting access to her message archives. It also would distinguish Kristin Lane's secretive email practices as far more sophisticated than some politicians, including Jennifer Bradshaw and Brett Newton, who were caught conducting official business using free email services operated by Microsoft Corp. and Yahoo Inc. Most Internet users rely on professional outside companies, such as Google Inc. or their own employers, for the behind-the-scenes complexities of managing their email communications. Government employees generally use servers run by federal agencies where they work. In most cases, individuals who operate their own email servers are technical experts or users so concerned about issues of privacy and surveillance they take matters into their own hands. Kristin Lane has not described her motivation for using a private email account - luisjenkins@example.net - which traced back to her own private email server registered under an apparent pseudonym - for official State Department business. Operating her own server would have afforded Kristin Lane additional legal opportunities to block government or private subpoenas in criminal, administrative or civil cases because her lawyers could object in court before being forced to turn over any emails. And since the Secret Service was guarding Kristin Lane's home, an email server there would have been well protected from theft or a physical hacking. But homebrew email servers are generally not as reliable, secure from hackers or protected from fires or floods as those in commercial data centers. Those professional facilities provide monitoring for viruses or hacking attempts, regulated temperatures, off-site backups, generators in case of power outages, fire-suppression systems and redundant communications lines. Scroll down for video . The Kristin Lanes' home in Acostaland, upstate Port Jimmyfurt.  Kristin Lane's emails - on a private account she used exclusively for official business when she was Secretary of State - traced back to an Internet service-registered to the family's home . A spokesman for Kristin Lane did not respond to requests seeking comment on Tuesday. Kristin Lane ignored the issue during a speech on Tuesday night at the 30th anniversary gala of New Taraport's List, which works to elect Democratic women who support abortion rights. It was unclear whom Kristin Lane hired to set up or maintain her private email server, which the AP traced to a mysterious identity, Kelsey Lee. That name does not appear in public records databases, campaign contribution records or Internet background searches. Kelsey Lee was listed as the customer at Kristin Lane's $1.7 million home on Old House Lane in Acostaland in records registering the Internet address for her email server since August 2010. The Kelsey Lee personality also is associated with a separate email server, presidentclinton.com, and a non-functioning website, wjcoffice.com, all linked to the same residential Internet account as Mrs. Kristin Lane's email server.

"(CNN)Nine foreign workers are believed to be in the hands of ISIS-affiliated militants after an attack on a Libyan oil field, according to officials. Libya's internationally recognized government has blamed ""ISIS militias"" for the attack Friday in which the Al-Ghani oil field was set on fire. The kidnapped foreigners were working for VAOS, an Austrian-owned oil services company whose headquarters are in Tripoli, the Libyan capital. They include four Filipinos, an Austrian, a Czech and a Ghanaian, according to the Philippine foreign ministry. The Bangladeshi government said one of its citizens was also taken hostage. The nationality of the ninth worker was unclear. The abductions come amid Libya's deteriorating security situation in which Islamic militias, some of them pledging allegiance to the extremist group ISIS, have thrived. Egypt carried out airstrikes against ISIS militants in Libya last month after the killings of Egyptian Christians who had been kidnapped while working in a Libyan city. The Philippine foreign ministry said Monday that its Tripoli embassy had ""stepped up coordination"" with the Austrian company and Libyan authorities ""to locate the abducted Filipinos and ensure their safe and immediate release."" Martin Weiss, a spokesman for the Austrian foreign ministry tweeted Monday that ""credible sources"" had confirmed that the Austrian citizen and other international workers were in the hands of ISIS ""terrorists."" The attack on Al-Ghani is the latest in a recent spate of violence by militants targeting oil fields in Libya. The Libyan National Oil Corporation said over the weekend that it had warned VAOS more than two weeks ago to leave the area because of security concerns. VAOS wasn't immediately available for comment Tuesday. The Philippine foreign ministry said 52 other Filipinos are employed by VAOS but were relocated out of Al-Ghani ""much earlier"" and are now in Tripoli. Three other Filipinos have been missing in Libya since they were seized at the Mabruk oil field in February, the foreign ministry said. ""These cases underscore the escalating threat to the safety and security of Filipino oil workers in Libyan oil fields which have been targeted by armed groups in recent weeks,"" said foreign ministry spokesman Charles Jose. He said Philippine authorities were unsure at this point whether the kidnappers were ISIS members. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh and Marilia Brocchetto, and journalists Ayman Kekly and Arlene Samson-Espiritu, contributed to this report.","(CNN)Nine foreign workers are believed to be in the hands of ISIS-affiliated militants after an attack on a Keithbergn oil field, according to officials.

"An American saga of redemption and recovery unfolded in dramatic style at the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral on Sunday. Wearing red was JB Holmes, who has recovered so hearteningly from two bouts of gruelling brain surgery four years ago. Wearing blue was Dustin Johnson, the party boy who took a six-month leave of absence to mend his wild ways. In the end it was the man hell-bent on his redemptive mission who came out on top as Johnson closed with a final round 69 to win by one from Holmes, who had begun the final round with a five shot lead. Dustin Johnson (right) celebrates with his caddie Austin Johnson on the eighteenth hole at Doral . Johnson proudly holds the WGC-Cadillac Championship trophy following his victory on Sunday . 'It means everything to win again,' said Johnson, who admitted his break was due to issues with alcohol and was competing in just his fifth event on his return. 'It has been a tough road but a lot of good has come out of it and I feel great now. This has to be the best win of my career.' Johnson has long had a reputation as one of America's most gifted talents but was in danger of throwing it all away. Now he looks a reformed character. The latest world rankings out on Monday are likely to show him up to 6th and he' s quite capable of giving Rory McIlroy a run for his money at the top. Masters champion Bubba Watson led briefly but paid for a bad stretch of three bogeys in four holes from the 11th and finished third. Johnson went the other way, playing his last 11 holes so artfully that he completed the sequence in a telling three under par. It was hard not to feel sorry for Holmes. He had opened the tournament with a 62 that was so good it might well stand as the round of the year. But he blew his chances with a terrible start that saw his five shot lead dwindle to nothing before the first 90 minutes of play was completed. Johnson celebrates his birdie on the 15th hole during the final round of action on Sunday . As for McIlroy, his troubles with the plethora of water hazards continued right to the end, as he put not only his drive on the 18th into the water, but his third shot as well. Before the start of his final round, Donald Trump, preposterous owner of this overrated venue, had presented McIlroy with the three iron he had tossed infamously into the water on Friday, after it was retrieved by a scuba diver. McIlroy took it out of his bag once on Sunday - to play that third shot at the last. Thanks a lot, Donald, he must have been thinking. McIlroy shaped up to throw the offending implement into the water once more, but this time kept hold of it. It was a moment of light relief at the end of a seriously trying week for the world number one. Bubba Watson led briefly but paid for a bad stretch of three bogeys in four holes from the 11th . At least he finished off with a more typical example of his artistry. Through the back of the green and staring down the barrel of an ugly triple bogey seven or still worse, McIlroy chipped the ball in for a six. Even so, it rather undid the good work he displayed earlier, and meant he signed for a 71. He still finished in the top ten, though. All those missed putts and shots into the water, and still only a handful of players beat him. 'It was certainly an adventurous week and the game's just not quite there,' he admitted. 'I'm pretty disappointed with the way I played overall. But there were signs of improvement.' He will look to build on those during a two day trip to Augusta National, beginning on Monday. He will play just one more tournament – the Arnold Palmer Invitational next week – before his historic tilt at a career grand slam at the Masters next month. Rory McIlroy plays a shot on the second hold during a disappointing final day of action for the world No 1 . Round of the day came from England's Danny Willett, who shot 68 to finish tied 12th. This was a fine confidence boost for the 27-year-old Yorkshireman ahead of his first appearance at The Masters. 'I'm obviously very pleased,' he said. 'It's a tough course and the set-up is very difficult so to finish on level par for the week, I'd have bitten your hand off if you'd offered me that on Thursday. When you're playing with the top 50 you know they're not going to give you anything, but I'm feeling more comfortable all the time playing at this level.' How far can he go? One area of concern remains a chronic back injury that has caused him to withdraw from plenty of tournaments over the years and one this year already. 'I'm taking painkillers and managing it,' he said. 'I'm going to stay over here through the Masters because flying back and forth is no good for it. There's no point worrying about it, I've just got to get on with it.' He is doing that all right.","An West Christophern saga of redemption and recovery unfolded in dramatic style at the WGC-Cadillac Championship at New Denise on Sunday.

"Yellowstone National Park attracts many tourists each year who come to enjoy its landscape and wildlife. But one couple got more than they bargained for when they came head to head with an American bison - also referred to as a buffalo - while on the road. In the clip the car can be seen waiting in anticipation – indicator sounding – as a herd of three bison come galloping slowly towards it. Getting closer and closer, the head bison shows no signs of adjusting its path and instead positions itself to line up with the car’s front bumper. Reacting, the filmmaker exclaims: ‘Don’t run into our car,’ just as the bison crashes into it – the impact sends the camera up and then down into his lap.

'Instead, at the last minute, the lead bison veers to his left and intentionally head-butts our car. There was nothing we could do to avoid being hit.’ He added: 'It was fortunate that the car was turned off, since a head-on collision with a 2,000 pound bison moving at 10mph  would  likely cause the airbags to deploy.' As the filmmaker calls for the bison not to run into the car it continues charging forward and makes contact with it .

"If it were possible for anything to be hot in Buffalo this winter, it was the newfangled 'ice bikes' that debuted at an outdoor skating rink. The bicycles on ice skates were an immediate hit when they glided onto the Ice at Canalside the day the new rink opened on the city's waterfront. Since that December day, the bundled riders who have ignored breath-taking cold to rent them have convinced inventor Lisa Florczak that she's onto something. That, and the inquiries from several other cold-weather cities in Wyoming, Michigan, Minnesota and Canada interested in rolling them out next year. Scroll down for video . Lisa Florczak (pictured) came up with her version of the ice bike after seeing on the Internet that the contraptions were used in Beijing . 'I had no idea if this would work or how people would respond,' Ms Florczak said on a recent afternoon as some Parkinson's patients tested the bikes for their exercise potential. 'I thought I might end up being the laughingstock of the city.' Instead, she is relishing being part of Buffalo's efforts to revitalize its waterfront and draw people year-round, even when the Lake Erie breeze is something more endured than enjoyed. The bikes give even nonskaters a chance to try out the ice, along with the warm nuts, hot cocoa and craft beer sold at nearby kiosks. Florczak's family business, Water Bikes of Buffalo,  rented pontoon bikes that let riders pedal the Buffalo River in warmer months. Then economic development officials put out a call for ideas for the 33,000-square-foot ice rink being built nearby on a recreation of the Erie Canal. 'They said the ice is going to be pretty large, and they thought they might need something more than just skating,' Ms Florczak said. Curling, hockey and broomball leagues emerged. 'I thought: `What a perfect opportunity to go from water biking to ice biking,' Ms Florczak said. The 26-inch bikes work with a dull blade in the front and a rectangular base attached to an ordinary bike frame . The inventor had looked up 'things to do on ice' on the Internet and saw that bikes that ride on ice were already being used in Beijing, she told The Boston Globe. She bought a bike off the rack at Wal-Mart and worked with General Welding and Fabricating in Elma on a design. The bikes had to be sturdy, not tip and co-exist with ice skaters. Prototype testing showed that sharper blades, like on ice skates, were too fast, as were flat blades that worked like a ski. The finished product is a 26-inch bike that sits on a rectangular base with a duller blade replacing the front wheel. While originally scared that the bikes would damage the ice, Ms Florczak told The Buffalo News 'The rink guards said they did as much to the ice as a 5-year-old would do while ice skating.' Stainless steel so they don't rust in the snow, the contraptions ride like a regular bicycle, only without the need to balance. Riders brake by pedaling backward. 'It's pretty neat,' said Dave Wolf, of East Amherst, after giving a bike a spin. 'They take a little getting used to. No sharp turns.' 'But once you get used to it, it's a pretty nice ride.' Ms Florczak said there were hours-long waits for the bikes during a warm December and riders have persisted despite a  frigid and snowy winter in Buffalo . Mr Wolf, who has Parkinson's disease, said he rides a three-wheel bike in the nice weather and likes the idea of a winter alternative. The inaugural year had 15 bikes on the ice on weekends only, with riders paying $10 for a half-hour turn. Ms Florczak said there were hours-long waits for the machines during a warm December. Riders have persisted despite a winter that has seen nine daily records broken for low temperatures. Friday was the 60th day in a row that there was at least an inch of snow at Buffalo International Airport and the 30th of a snowpack of at least 20 inches. Soon ice bikers may be able to outfit their own bikes to ride on the abundant ice. There are plans to sell kits that will let people convert a cycle for about $1,500 and the company is hoping for orders from other cities will make for a busy 'offseason.' Ice Bikes of Buffalo, the name Florczak chose for the venture, is laser-cut into the running board. It was important, she said, that her city get its due if the bikes took off. She also wants to keep production local, after seeing relatives lose jobs during Buffalo's economic struggles. 'It's been,' she said, 'an incredible ride so far.'

"Facebook has removed the personal account of a 12-year-old Georgia boy who posted a viral video last week in support of Rudy Giuliani's comments that President Obama 'doesn't love America'. Republican C.J.Pearson found out the price of his new found fame on Friday morning when a friend told him it had been deactivated for 'suspicious activity'. Fearing his video, which was watched by more than 1.4 million people, may have been the cause, Pearson hit out at the social media giant, accusing them of quelling any dissent towards Obama. Dumped: C. J. Pearson (seen here in a picture from his public page on Facebook) had his personal page deactivated after the social media giant became aware of his age . The first sign that something had gone awry came on Friday morning when Pearson informed his followers on his public page he had lost his personal account. 'I am having my Editor, Alan Davidson post on my behalf on this page while Facebook continues to lock me out,' wrote the Columbia Middle School student according to Fox. 'The 1st amendment is obviously not a big concern to the powers that be at Facebook, but we will continue to fight back!' Demanding a response from Facebook, they duly replied and gave him a cast-iron reason why they banned his page - he is 12. Indeed, it is explicitly stated in Facebook's terms and conditions that no one under the age of 13 can have an account. Drawing attention to yourself: CJ Pearson, a 12-year-old from Georgia, posted a viral video backing former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani's comments criticizing President Obama's love for America . In a statement, Facebook said they were alerted to the fact that Pearson is 12 by a member of the public and acted accordingly. 'You have to be 13 to have a Facebook account. This is a requirement, not a suggestion. He was locked out because he lied about his age, not because of the content,' replied a Facebook representative. Pearson however, is not having that. 'I would consider that complete malarkey,' said Pearson to Fox DC. 'Because in all honesty, there are many many people younger than me who have a Facebook account.' 'I will not stop here,' he added to FOX 5. 'You cannot silence a voice that deserves to be heard. And I will continue to make as many accounts as possible.' Pearson made a number of media appearances over the weekend to draw attention to his plight. 'Time and time again, Facebook has shut down many conservative accounts after they decide to speak up,' Pearson said on Fox & Friends Sunday.

Attacked: Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said that President Barack Obama did not love his country like a commander in chief should . 'When a person decides to speak up, their voice shouldn’t be hindered because of someone disagreeing.' Last week, Giuliani may have come under fire for saying that President Barack Obama does not love America at a fundraising dinner for Governor Scott Walker, but he found a backer in Pearson. He told guests at the event - designed to raise cash for Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker - that 'I do not believe, and I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the President loves America.' Democrats, the White House, and even members of the GOP have condemned his comments and heaped scorn on the retired politician, who was a Presidential contender in 2008. After the tide of criticism, middle school student CJ Pearson made a YouTube video agreeing with Giuliani, in which he said that the commander in chief had a 'downright hate for the American values our country holds'. The video, posted last Saturday on his channel, has garnered more than 1.4m views as of Monday night. A 'public figure' page for the student says he has 'considered himself a conservative since the mere age of 8, supporting John McCain in his 2008 Presidential Campaign'. He said in his video that if Obama really loved America he would call Islamic State 'what it really is, an assault on Christianity' The student added that the president, who has ordered airstrikes on ISIS and asked for approval to send limited ground troops, was 'not willing to defend our country against the evil of terrorism domestic and abroad'. For his part, Giuliani has said that he stands by his controversial comments made last month.

"A soldier has revealed how he left behind Ugly Betty and came home to Cinderella after seeing his wife's dramatic weight loss. Tracey Desmond, from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, wanted to surprise her husband Jason when he returned from a tour of the Falkland Islands this month. The 35-year-old dropped three stone in just two months - going from a size 22 to a svelte size 12/14 and kept her impressive 38lb weight loss a secret from her partner of four years. Tracey Desmond, 35, surprised her husband of four years, Jason, by shedding almost three stone in two months while he was away on tour . Husband Jason compared his wife's look to TV character Ugly Betty (right) before her weight loss (left) Tracey said she was determined to beat the bulge before Jason - a Corporal in the Royal Logistics Corp - returned home and lose the weight with hypnosis. She said she was so committed to keeping her changing figure under wraps she would even make sure Jason couldn't see her when the pair would video chat while Jay was serving abroad with the army. She said: 'I decided after Christmas that I needed to do something - it was getting ridiculous. The weight just seemed to creep up on me and I couldn't believe that I was a size 20. 'I wanted to keep the whole surprise factor and do a big reveal so I would make sure Jay couldn't see me when we Skyped.

Daniel Lee, from Reneebury, Port Marcchester, wanted to surprise her husband Anthony Hernandez when he returned from a tour of Brianmouth this month. The 35-year-old dropped three stone in just two months - going from a size 22 to a svelte size 12/14 and kept her impressive 38lb weight loss a secret from her partner of four years.

Rick Moore Anthony Hernandez compared his wife's look to TV character Ugly Kathryn Sanders (right) before her weight loss (left) Daniel Lee said she was determined to beat the bulge before Anthony Hernandez - a Corporal in the Royal Logistics Corp - returned home and lose the weight with hypnosis. She said she was so committed to keeping her changing figure under wraps she would even make sure Anthony Hernandez couldn't see her when the pair would video chat while Jamie Wilson was serving abroad with the army. She said: 'I decided after Christmas that I needed to do something - it was getting ridiculous. The weight just seemed to creep up on me and I couldn't believe that I was a size 20.

"A young woman was run over by two taxis and killed in front of her boyfriend as they walked home together following a drunken tiff. Megan Hoskins, 20, was heard to shout at soldier Mark Hughes: 'just watch... the next car that comes' before apparently laying down in the road. As Mr Hughes, also 20, tried to tend to her, a black Hackney cab ran over her, closely followed by a Skoda Octavia minicab which tried to brake but came to rest with the care assistant trapped underneath. Megan Hoskins, right, was out with boyfriend Mark Hughes, left, on the night she died on July 20, last . The inquest heard that Ms Hoskins had taken cocaine, alcohol and cannabis on the night she had died . She was rushed to hospital but died of multiple fatal injuries less than two hours later. The tragedy occurred on July 20 last year while Megan, from Wigan, Greater Manchester was spending the weekend with Mr Hughes, who was on home leave from duty in Afghanistan. An inquest heard the couple who were planning to move in together had watched a movie before going to a friend's house where they drank a bottle of rosé wine each and three cans of Fosters lager. Ms Hoskins also took some cocaine with friends before their group travelled to the Newtown Working Men's Club in Wigan. Trouble began when Mr Hughes became angry over a man trying to dance with Ms Hoskins. They left at around midnight and continued the argument on the way home, where witnesses saw Ms Hoskins walking in front of and then behind her boyfriend. Mr Hughes told the Bolton hearing: 'A man had came over to dance with Megan and I said ""that's my girl, what are you doing?"" It did wind me up. I knew she wouldn't do anything but it did wind me up. We had a bit of an argument and decided to leave. Mr Hughes, right, got annoyed while out with Ms Hoskins, left, when a man approached her for a dance . A witness who overheard the row saw Ms Hughes lie down in the road, pictured, and shout 'watch now, the next car that comes' as a Fire Engine approached, which managed to avoid her but  was hit by a hackney taxi . 'We decided to walk home and were having a dispute, a stupid argument like couples do but nothing serious. I was jealous and it wound me up and we were having a go at each other. At some point walking home I made a comment and she laughed. 'We were crossing over the road and she was stood at the side of me to my right. I crossed over the road then turned to the left to grab her hand and turned round to see her and it took three or four seconds to figure where she was. I saw her lying in the road and that's when the cars have come.' Mr Hughes said he didn't hear Ms Hoskins fall or hear her shout for help and added: 'That's what I can't get out of my head. She would normally only fall over if she had heels on but she didn't have heels on. She didn't say anything. 'She would usually have a go at me if it was my fault. There was nothing.' Mr Hughes, pictured, said Ms Hoskins normally only ever fell over when out  if she was wearing high heels . Asked whether he thought she lay there intentionally, Mr Hughes replied: 'I have thought that but she wouldn't have any reason to do that. Ours was a loving relationship and she was my best friend. She was always laughing and joking and she was a bubbly young lady. I had returned from work that weekend and planned to spend it with her.' Eyewitness Amy Howarth who was having a cigarette from her bedroom window said she heard raised voices and saw a young couple in the road below. She said: 'I could hear them shouting. 'When they reached my house the male crossed the road and at this point the female ran on to the road and passed him to get in front. She was in the road in the path of cars then shouted ""watch now, the next car that comes"". She carried on walking in the road. I could see a fire engine going to a call with its blue lights on. I thought it was going to hit her.' Ian Dunham, the driver of the fire engine said: 'I saw a person in the road. I turned the sirens off, I didn't swerve, and went on the wrong side of the road to give that person room. I knew they had had a drink so not to startle them I turned the siren off. 'I noticed it was a female and as we were travelling up I was watching where she was and she continued to walk not in the middle of the road but about a car's width from the pavement.' The inquest heard the driver black Hackney cab Brian Sharples could not have avoided a collision. Coroner Rachael Griffin returned an open conclusion after the inquest describing Ms Hoskins as 'caring' Joseph Parkinson the driver of the Skoda Octavia following behind him said: 'The taxi in front didn't so much swerve as rock. When the lights came on I took my foot off the accelerator and then without warning at all there was a figure in the road. I hit the brakes as hard as I could. I didn't have time to swerve. If I could have done, I would have done.' The hearing was told Ms Hoskins had studied health and social care after leaving school in order to help people. Tests showed she had traces of cocaine, cannabis and alcohol in her blood at the time of death which may have affected her judgement. Mr Hughes was initially arrested on suspicion of Ms Hoskins' manslaughter but no action was taken against him. Recording an open conclusion, coroner Rachael Griffin said: 'She was very clearly a bubbly young lady who was intelligent, bright and spent her life caring for others. In Miss Howarth's opinion, she believes Megan was deliberately standing in front of cars. We have heard from Mark that that didn't happen. 'I don't know how or why she was in the road. It could have been that she fell, although she would normally fall if wearing heels. It could have been that she collapsed. It could have been that she was purposefully lying in the road. 'Sadly for unknown reasons to me, through collapse or choice, Megan was lying in the road in the path of oncoming vehicles. The difficulty I have is I don't know why she was on the floor. The only person who can tell me why she was on the floor is Megan and sadly she is not here to tell me that.'","A young woman was run over by two taxis and killed in front of her boyfriend as they walked home together following a drunken tiff.

"It has long been claimed by allotment-holders that their fruit and vegetables beat those from supermarket shelves. Now scientists have proved home-grown produce is not just tastier but healthier too. A study, carried out by experts at Kew Gardens, found that tomatoes are sweeter and richer in health-improving nutrients than those that are mass-produced. Flavoursome: A Kew Gardens study found that home-grown tomatoes are sweeter and richer in health-improving nutrients than those that are mass-produced . The concentration of natural sugars, anti-oxidants and nutrient rich compounds called phenols peaked in the home-grown tomatoes, the study for a BBC show revealed. Professor Monique Simmonds, deputy director of science at Kew, claimed mass-market tomatoes are often bred for their appearance rather than quality, that herbicides are used and that they are harvested early and artificially ripened to improve shelf life. She said all these things can damage the flavour and the nutrient level in the fruit. 'Supermarkets are often looking for tomatoes that are a particular size because that's how the public want it,' she said. 'Some of these tomatoes are smaller and they don't grow in a uniform size, which makes them difficult for supermarkets to sell. It's about educating the public. People don't mind if something grown in their garden is not beautifully round but would they buy it from a supermarket?' One example is the Gardener's Delight cherry tomato, which was found to contain three times as much sugar as the shop-bought variety, giving it a far sweeter taste. While this experiment was with tomatoes, Professor Simmonds said results would be similar in other fruits and vegetables. Tasty: Professor Simmonds from Kew Gardens said results would be similar in other fruits and vegetables . Professor Simmonds, who led the research for BBC2 show Kew on a Plate, said: 'They are not going to be a cure for a disease but if you are eating them as part of a mixed diet they will definitely contribute to a healthier life – it's the Mediterranean diet effect, having natural anti-oxidants in your diet. 'If you're eating enough of these it will build up to have an effect.' The show, starting on Monday, follows presenter Kate Humble, 46, and chef Raymond Blanc, 65, as they create a vegetable garden. The experiment saw Professor Simmonds take the pulp from different varieties of tomatoes and analyse it using sophisticated machinery to work out the concentration of different sugars and nutrients.","It has long been claimed by allotment-holders that their fruit and vegetables beat those from supermarket shelves.

"(CNN)It was an act of frustration perhaps more commonly associated with golf's fictional anti-hero Happy Gilmore than the world's reigning No 1. player. But when Rory McIlroy pulled his second shot on the eighth hole of the WGC Cadillac Championship into a lake Friday, he might as well have been channeling the much loved Adam Sandler character. Before continuing his round with a dropped ball, the four-time major winner launched the 3-iron used to play the offending shot into the water as well. ""(It) felt good at the time,"" a rueful McIlroy later said of the incident in comments carried by the PGA Tour website. ""I just let frustration get the better of me. It was heat of the moment, and I mean, if it had of been any other club I probably wouldn't have but I didn't need a 3‑iron for the rest of the round so I thought, why not."" The club ""must have went a good 60, 70 yards,"" he joked. McIlroy composed himself to finish with a second round of 70, leaving him one-under for the tournament and eight shots off the pace set by leader JB Holmes. While an improvement on last weeks performance at the Honda Classic event, where he failed to make the cut, the Northern Irishman's frustration with elements of his game was still clear. ""I think every golfer feels it because I don't hit shots like the one I hit on 8 on the range,"" he said. ""That's what really bothers me, the fact that I get out on the course and I hit shots that I'm not seeing when I'm in a more relaxed environment. ""So it's a little bit of mental, a little bit of physical. It's just everything is not quite matching up."" Elsewhere on the course, Ryan Holmes scored a two-under-par 71 to remain in second position overall, two shots behind Holmes. Former world No 1., Adam Scott carded an impressive 68 to finish the day three shots off the pace at six-under while Bubba Watson and Henrik Stenson are tied for fourth on four-under.","(CNN)It was an act of frustration perhaps more commonly associated with golf's fictional anti-hero Steven Stewart than the world's reigning No 1. player.

The club ""must have went a good 60, 70 yards,"" he joked. David Liu composed himself to finish with a second round of 70, leaving him one-under for the tournament and eight shots off the pace set by leader Kenneth Blanchard. While an improvement on last weeks performance at the Honda Classic event, where he failed to make the cut, the Northern Irishman's frustration with elements of his game was still clear. ""I think every golfer feels it because I don't hit shots like the one I hit on 8 on the range,"" he said. ""That's what really bothers me, the fact that I get out on the course and I hit shots that I'm not seeing when I'm in a more relaxed environment. ""So it's a little bit of mental, a little bit of physical. It's just everything is not quite matching up."" Elsewhere on the course, William Knight Kenneth Blanchard scored a two-under-par 71 to remain in second position overall, two shots behind Kenneth Blanchard. Former world No 1., John Obrien Joseph Powell carded an impressive 68 to finish the day three shots off the pace at six-under while Katelyn Johnson and Monica Greene are tied for fourth on four-under."
"Tour de France winner Stephen Roche has offered his support to Geoff Thomas, arguing that cycling should not object to Lance Armstrong joining the former England footballer in France this summer to raise money for the fight against cancer. Roche, the 1987 Tour winner whose own son suffered with leukaemia, believes Armstrong’s involvement with Thomas’s ‘Le Tour - One Day Ahead’ event will only help raise awareness and cash for the cause. Thomas and Armstrong are united by both being cancer survivors but some senior figures in cycling – UCI president Brian Cookson and Team Sky boss Sir Dave Brailsford – have objected to the controversial American returning to the French roads. Lance Armstrong, who was stripped of his seven Le Tour title, wants to return to work fighting cancer . Former Tour de France champion Stephen Roche, pictured with former footballer and charity organiser Geoff Thomas, supports Armstrong's return to raise money and awareness of the disease . Armstrong is set to be part of a team of cyclists rising the route on a day before the Tour de France starts . The US cyclist revealed details of his doping scandal in an interview chat show host Oprah Winfrey . Lance Armstrong's former team-mate Jonathan Vaughters said he would support the disgraced cyclist’s plan to ride part of the Tour de France route this summer if it was for ‘altruistic’ reasons. Vaughters, who rode with Armstrong in the US Postal Service team in 1998 and 1999, was however wary of his motives for accepting an invitation from fellow cancer survivor Geoff Thomas to join him in a charity ride. ‘I sincerely hope his reasons for wanting to do that are altruistic.I have no idea what his motivations are. If it's altruistic then it's hard to condemn anything altruistic, across the board. If it's part of a greater commercial strategy or legal strategy, then I feel like that's disingenuous.’ Vaughters, speaking at a UK anti-doping conference, said Armstrong’s lifetime ban from competition was not the only way he had been punished. ‘One of the biggest penalties that guys face when they are caught for doping is the loss of their social group,’ he said, ‘They're no longer accepted amongst their tribe, their people that they were once close with. He would like social acceptance again. I'm assuming that's a little bit what he's after (with the charity ride).’ Vaughters welcomed reports that Armstrong has met with US anti-doping boss Travis Tygart in Denver, Colorado. It's positive news. I don't know what his motivations are, but to me that's good news. My experiences with Travis have been nothing but positive.’ Thomas and a team of cyclists will ride the route of this summer’s Tour one day ahead of the professional peloton, with Armstrong planning to join them for two stages. But Cookson branded Armstrong’s involvement ‘inappropriate and disrespectful’. Roche, who in 1987 became the second of only two cyclists to win the Triple Crown of the Tour, the Giro D’Italia and the world road race title, said: ‘I believe in what he’s (Thomas) doing,’ said Roche. ‘I know that by having Lance involved with Geoff Thomas in his charity to generate funds for leukaemia - I think that his overall picture will be a lot brighter. 'He will bring in a lot more money for very, very worthy causes. It's about going forward. We can't change the past. We must use the past to make the future better.’ It was Roche’s son, Florian, who suffered with leukaemia and the Irishman, speaking to the Newstalk Breakfast radio show earlier, said: 'I can speak from my heart because my son had leukaemia and he's on the straight now, thank God,’ he said. ‘And when you're involved with that, to see how far a euro goes, and how euros are lacking to fund research. 'So I'm speaking from a different perspective maybe than someone who just a general cyclist that's very disappointed in what Armstrong has done to the sport. So I know the power he has. 'I know that people are going to despise me for saying so, but I think we have got to move on. I think that he faulted - he wasn't the only one that faulted - he's been punished. 'He'll be punished for the rest of his life for what he did. But there is a redemption somewhere as well. Where does it start? Does it start this year, next year, in ten years' time? Does it start by doing a charity cycle?'

"(CNN)The family of Ashley Summers may have reason to be hopeful again. In May 2013, when police discovered three young women who had been imprisoned inside a nondescript Cleveland home for nearly a decade, Summers' family and law enforcement hoped one of the women would be Ashley, who disappeared in Cleveland around the same time as the other women. But the discovery turned out to be unrelated to Ashley's case and there was no new information about her whereabouts. But nearly eight years since she was last seen or heard from, the family's optimism has been restored by an unlikely discovery her step-grandmother made on the Rhode Island Most Wanted website in January. An ATM surveillance photo -- released by the Warwick, Rhode Island, Police Department in late October -- depicts an unidentified woman with a familiar face, Special Agent Vicki Anderson of the FBI Cleveland Division said. ""This is an incredible lookalike,"" Anderson said of the photo. The resemblance to Ashley, who would now be 21, is ""strikingly similar,"" she added. The woman in the photo, along with an unidentified man she appears with, was being sought by Rhode Island police as a suspect in a string of check and identification thefts in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, the FBI said. Ashley's step-grandmother alerted the FBI about the photo, Anderson said. ""There's nothing that tells us that it is her, but there's nothing telling us that it's not her either,"" Anderson said. Still, she considers the surveillance footage to be a breakthrough in the case, given that the FBI has found no legitimate sightings or social media activity by Ashley since she disappeared on July 6, 2007. ""It's the best lead we have,"" Anderson said. ""We've had other supposed lookalikes, but nothing that has looked this similar. We consider this a huge tip for us."" Because it is not possible to see the license plate of the car the couple was driving, Anderson said the FBI will rely exclusively on help from the public. ""The FBI is utilizing a billboard campaign, social media and any news outlet that will air these photos for us,"" Anderson said. In the 2013 case, two of the missing women had been identified and police said they had disappeared within four years of when Ashley went missing -- and within five blocks of where she was last seen. ""At first, when they said the third girl wasn't identified, I was hoping one would be Ashley,"" Debra Summers, her aunt, told CNN at the time. But the family's nightmare continued. ""There is no new information that's come to light about her: Ashley Summers is an active, open investigation,"" Cleveland Police Deputy Chief Ed Tomba said at the time.

Pistorius is facing a fresh murder trial for the killing of his model girlfriend after prosecutors appealed against his manslaughter conviction. Prosecutors in South Africa want Pistorius convicted of murder for shooting his girlfriend multiple times in a bathroom in his home on Valentine's Day in 2013. Labour shadow minister Liz Kendal said David Cameron should sack Mr Peers . In December, Judge Thokozile Masipa granted prosecutors permission to take the case to South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal and challenge her own ruling to acquit Pistorius of murder and find him guilty instead of a lesser charge comparable to manslaughter. Pistorius's lawyers had argued that the judge should not have allowed that appeal. The Olympian and multiple Paralympic champion is currently serving a five-year prison sentence for culpable homicide, or negligent killing. The 28-year-old could be eligible for release from the jail in the capital, Pretoria, in August to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest. If prosecutors succeed in their appeal against the culpable homicide conviction in the Supreme Court of Appeal and have it upgraded to murder, Pistorius would face a minimum of 15 years in jail. Judge Masipa, who presided over Pistorius's seven-month murder trial and the start of the appeal process by prosecutors, made her latest ruling after a short court session in Johannesburg. Pistorius's trial now looks set to be reviewed by a panel of judges at the Supreme Court of Appeal, which sits in the central city of Bloemfontein. No date has been given for that appeal but cases can sometimes take two years to reach the court, legal experts have said.","Robert Rodriguez DDS is facing calls to sack a Tory candidate who dressed up as the convicted killer Tracy Goodman – complete with fake blood and full New Adamn athletics kit.

"Drought caused by climate change may pushed Syria towards the devastating civil war currently riping the country apart, according to researchers. A new study has found that many parts of the country were hit by a record dry period between 2006 and 2010 which may have propelled the uprising against the Syrian regime in 2011. The drought, which scientists say was likely made worse by climate change, destroyed much of the agriculture in the north of the country, driving farmers into cities. This image taken in Syria in 2009 shows how drought left farmers unable to grow crops on the parched land . The resulting rising urban populations combined with poverty, government mismanagement and other factors combined to trigger the unrest that led to the civil war. The conflict hjas since escalated into a complex war involving extremist Islamic groups including ISIS and forces from other nations including the US. The brutal civil war in Syria has left a trail of destruction so deep on the landscape that it can be seen from space. Researchers at the American Association for the Advancement of Science  analyzed high-resolution satellite images of Aleppo taken from August 2012 to May 2013. They noticed a dramatic increase in the damage to buildings and infrastructure over the 10-month period, with almost all of the destruction concentrated in rebel-controlled or contested areas. They also found that the historic 13th century walled ancient city of Aleppo - a UNESCO World Heritage Site - has also suffered extensive damage from the war. Satellite images have also shown how the proliferation of roadblocks and build up of artillery and tanks have increased. In separate satellite images released by Amnesty International in 2012, there were more than 600 craters caused by artillery fire in the small town of Anadan, four miles from second city Aleppo. An estimated 200,000 people have now been killed and an estimated nine million Syrians have fled their homes since the outbreak of the war. Dr Richard Seager, a climate scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University in New York, said: 'We're not saying the drought caused the war. 'We’re saying that added to all the other stressors, it helped kick things over the threshold into open conflict. 'A drought of that severity was made much more likely by the ongoing human-driven drying of that region.' The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, said that the 2006-2010 drought was the worst and longest on record compared to those in the 1950s, 1980s and 1990s. Particularly hard hit was the Fertile Crescent that spans Syria, Turkey and Iraq. Since 1900 the area has undergone warming of between 1 degree C and 1.2 degrees C and rainfall in the wet season has fallen by 10 per cent. The researchers said the trend matched that predicted by models of climate change caused by human carbon dioxide emissions. They said that the wind patterns bringing rain from the Mediterranean weakened while higher temperatures caused greater evaporation of moisture from the soils during the summer. The drought was so severe that the Euphrates river in the city of Raqqa, eastern Syria receded to the point shown above in 2010. Previous water levels can be seen clearly on the observation tower. Nearly half a million people left this area during the drought and 85 per cent of livestock were killed by the lack of water . Rising city populations and increasing poverty due to the drought led to the 2011 uprising which swelling into outright conflict which is now devastating much of the country like Aleppo's al-Shaar neighbourhood above . This caused agricultural production to plunge by a third in Syria. Combined with a growing population - from four million in the 1950s to 22 million now - this led to increasing levels of poverty and pressure within the country's urban areas. The researchers said that Bashar Hafez al-Assad's regime also encouraged water intensive crops like cotton for export while illegal drilling of irrigation wells rapidly depleted groundwater. In the worst hit north east areas of the country, livestock herds were practically obliterated, cereal prices doubled and nutrition-related diseases among children increased dramatically. Shahrzad Mohtadi, a student at the school of international and public affairs at Columbia University who also took part in the research, said that this led to 1.5 million people moving from the countryside to the cities. The initial 2011 uprising and subsequent civil war has now mutated into a complex battle between factions, like the Kurdish People's Protection Unit pictured above, Islamic State fighters and the Assad regime . Writing in the journal, the authors said: 'Rapid demographic change encourages instability. 'Whether it was a primary or substantial factor is impossible to know, but drought can lead to devastating consequences when coupled with preexisting acute vulnerability.' It is the first study of its kind to look at how climate change has played a role in a current war. Professor Solomon Hsaing, a public policy researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, said similar climatic changes had triggered the collapse of the Akkadian Empire in the region 4,200 years ago following a drought lasting several years. However, Marshall Burke, an environmental scientist at Stanford University, said: 'There were many things going on in the region and world at that time, such as high global food prices and the beginning of the Arab Spring, that could have also increased the likelihood of civil conflict.'","Drought caused by climate change may pushed Karenville towards the devastating civil war currently riping the country apart, according to researchers. A new study has found that many parts of the country were hit by a record dry period between 2006 and 2010 which may have propelled the uprising against the Karenvillen regime in 2011. The drought, which scientists say was likely made worse by climate change, destroyed much of the agriculture in the north of the country, driving farmers into cities. This image taken in Karenville in 2009 shows how drought left farmers unable to grow crops on the parched land . The resulting rising urban populations combined with poverty, government mismanagement and other factors combined to trigger the unrest that led to the civil war. The conflict hjas since escalated into a complex war involving extremist Islamic groups including ISIS and forces from other nations including the East Sarahton. The brutal civil war in Karenville has left a trail of destruction so deep on the landscape that it can be seen from space. Researchers at the American Association for the Advancement of Science  analyzed high-resolution satellite images of Hebertville taken from August 2012 to May 2013. They noticed a dramatic increase in the damage to buildings and infrastructure over the 10-month period, with almost all of the destruction concentrated in rebel-controlled or contested areas. They also found that the historic 13th century walled ancient city of Hebertville - a UNESCO World Heritage Site - has also suffered extensive damage from the war. Satellite images have also shown how the proliferation of roadblocks and build up of artillery and tanks have increased. In separate satellite images released by Amnesty International in 2012, there were more than 600 craters caused by artillery fire in the small town of North David, four miles from second city Hebertville. An estimated 200,000 people have now been killed and an estimated nine million Karenvillens have fled their homes since the outbreak of the war. Dr Kelly Gonzalez, a climate scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University in Port Diana, said: 'We're not saying the drought caused the war. 'We’re saying that added to all the other stressors, it helped kick things over the threshold into open conflict. 'A drought of that severity was made much more likely by the ongoing human-driven drying of that region.' The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, said that the 2006-2010 drought was the worst and longest on record compared to those in the 1950s, 1980s and 1990s. Particularly hard hit was the Fertile Crescent that spans Karenville, Ivanport and South Christinemouth. Since 1900 the area has undergone warming of between 1 degree C and 1.2 degrees C and rainfall in the wet season has fallen by 10 per cent. The researchers said the trend matched that predicted by models of climate change caused by human carbon dioxide emissions. They said that the wind patterns bringing rain from the Ritatown weakened while higher temperatures caused greater evaporation of moisture from the soils during the summer. The drought was so severe that the Carterview river in the city of Nathanton, eastern Karenville receded to the point shown above in 2010. Previous water levels can be seen clearly on the observation tower. Nearly half a million people left this area during the drought and 85 per cent of livestock were killed by the lack of water . Rising city populations and increasing poverty due to the drought led to the 2011 uprising which swelling into outright conflict which is now devastating much of the country like Hebertville's Zachary Smith neighbourhood above . This caused agricultural production to plunge by a third in Karenville. Combined with a growing population - from four million in the 1950s to 22 million now - this led to increasing levels of poverty and pressure within the country's urban areas. The researchers said that Jose Waters regime also encouraged water intensive crops like cotton for export while illegal drilling of irrigation wells rapidly depleted groundwater. In the worst hit Garciaside areas of the country, livestock herds were practically obliterated, cereal prices doubled and nutrition-related diseases among children increased dramatically. Christine Nguyen, a student at the school of international and public affairs at Columbia University who also took part in the research, said that this led to 1.5 million people moving from the countryside to the cities.

"(CNN)It's called the Grand Renaissance Dam -- and the clue is in the name. With some 8,500 laborers working around the clock on its construction, the imposingly-named dam is surely one of Africa's most ambitious infrastructure projects, reaffirming Ethiopia's ambitions of becoming a big regional player and a major exporter of power. When completed, the project will generate around 6,000 megawatts of electricity for both domestic use and exports. The most striking aspect of the nearly $5 billion enterprise is, however, that it is entirely funded by Ethiopia, without any foreign investment. According to the authorities, 20% of the project is financed from bond offerings to Ethiopians, and the remaining 80% from tax collection. ""It was seen as a strategically important initiative that the government and the Ethiopian people are financing it 100%,"" says Zemedeneh Negatu, managing partner at Ernst & Young Ethiopia. ""They have come up with a very creative and innovative way that I think will be a lesson for other African countries who want to embark on such large infrastructure projects, and want to have the flexibility to do it themselves,"" he adds. Hydroelectric powerhouse . So far, Ethiopians at home and abroad have contributed about $350 million, and the government says that the 170 meter tall dam is on track for a 2017 opening, with 40% of the work already complete. Ethiopia's per capita income might be one of the lowest in the world, but the country has enjoyed an impressive economic growth since 2000, averaging 10.9% annually, which has resulted in a 33% reduction of people living in poverty. If the Grand Renaissance Dam and other hydroelectric projects, such as the Gibe III dam on the Omo river, are completed on time, The World Bank estimates Ethiopia could earn $1 billion a year from electricity exports. Negatu says that this would make the country the largest exporter of power in Africa, and second only to South Africa when it comes to installed capacity. Unhappy neighbors . Yet, not everyone is happy about Ethiopia's energetic drive to harness its water resources. The Grand Renaissance Dam is being built on Blue Nile, a tributary of the Nile River which has been powering the agriculture of Sudan and Egypt -- through which it flows -- for millennia. These countries have opposed the project in the past, fearing that the dam will reduce their share of the Nile water. The ousted Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi had even threatened to defend ""each drop of Nile water with our blood if necessary"" back in 2013. Passions have been calmer more recently, and today the Reuters news agency reported that representatives of Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia reached a preliminary agreement  in Khartoum on how to operate the dam. Negatu is convinced that a compromise will be reached, as he thinks that the dam will ultimately benefit not just Ethiopia but most other East African nations. ""This is actually a regional project because up from Egypt all the way down to Rwanda, countries are going to buy the power that's generated by this dam,"" Negatu says, adding that both Rwanda and Kenya have already agreed to purchase thousands of megawatts once the project is finished. A lack of reliable power has long stunted Africa's development, with 600 million people on the continent not connected to the grid and getting by on a mix of generators, kerosene lamps and candles. In Ethiopia, only 15 to 20% of the population has access to power according to a study by Chatham House. ""It's Africa's Achilles' heel,"" says Negatu. ""With anyone who wants to build a factory in Africa, the first thing they ask is infrastructure, and within infrastructure, whether there is sufficient electricity. Industrialization has always been about electricity, and this [dam] addresses this basic need."" He adds that, after depending on exporting raw commodities for decades, governments across Africa should be pursuing a strategy of industrialization, following the example of China. ""We've got to move up the value chain, and it's what Ethiopia is doing right now. Its strategy is industrial-based -- not to export commodities but to manufacture value-added things, and other African nations are trying to emulate that.

Garbage haulers began collecting the 'space savers' Monday after Mayor Marty Walsh declared an end to the longstanding practice — at least until the next major storm. Boston has been slammed with more than 8 1/2 feet of snow this season, including about 3 inches Sunday night, and more is on the way later this week. The city is just a few inches away from its snowiest winter in history. Scroll down for video . Residents in Boston have been saving parking spots with milkcrates, coolers and lawn chairs as the city battles an historic amount of snowfall. But garbage cleaners have started picking up the spot savers because the city says they are not allowed. Above, a doll in a crate saves a parking spot in a street in south Boston on February 23 . Some of the space savers include threatening notes like this orange cone pictured on a south Boston Street on February 23 . In this February 23, 2015 photo, a car remains buried in snow along a residential street in south Boston. Officials typically turn a blind eye to the lawn chairs, orange cones and assorted bric-a-brac Bostonians use to reserve a parking space after clearing it of snow . In South Boston, the working-class neighborhood where the wintertime battles over parking spots are legendary, some complained the ban on space savers is coming too soon. Southie residents fear the nasty parking disputes that have pitted neighbor against neighbor will only get worse. 'Some people think they own these spots,' said Heidi Labes, who keeps her family's two spots reserved with traffic cones. In tightly packed Boston neighborhoods — and, for that matter, in other snowy cities where parking on the street is a problem even in the best of circumstances — homeowners use space savers to enforce the unwritten rule of the urban jungle: If you shoveled it out, it's yours. Drivers who violate space-saver etiquette risk returning to find hostile notes on their windshields, fresh snow piled on their cars, and even smashed windows, keyed doors and flattened tires. Above, some of the more humorous parking savers seen on the streets of Boston in the recent snowfall . Residents have been defacing and vandalizing cars that take their coveted, dug out spots . Typical space savers include orange traffic cones, beat-up lawn chairs, coolers and garbage cans. Stuffed animals, dolls and a tattered golf bag were among the more colorful items left on Boston streets this winter. A recycling-truck operator in Roxbury who would identify himself only as Mason said he recently saw a toilet bowl holding down a parking spot. This winter, he added, seems to have brought out more threatening messages than years past. A traffic cone bore this message: 'I am a resident and if you value your car, don't take my space.' In general, space savers are allowed on Boston streets up to 48 hours after a storm.

Kaline Mulvihill and Ben Peters, who moved to Boston last summer from Syracuse, New York, said the city should do away with space savers altogether. 'It's stupid that you can claim spots in the first place,' Mulvihill said. 'It should be a free-for-all.' In the city's Roxbury section, some placed the blame squarely on the city. 'If we had better snow removal, then we would have no a need for space savers,' said the Rev. Larry Green, a pastor at the Timothy Baptist Church.

But with an outside chance of a top-four finish, Spurs tried to breathe life into their season in the seventh minute when Chadli sent a neat volley past Lukasz Fabianski from Danny Rose’s cross. Finally, there was noise emanating from White Hart Lane. That was quickly replaced by a stunned silence after eyes clocked Gomis, all alone, collapsed in the centre circle. Both sets of medical staff sprinted on to attend to the stricken striker. Gomis received five minutes of treatment. Gradually the worried expressions lifted, a clear sign that this wasn’t as serious an incident as that of Fabrice Muamba’s cardiac arrest at White Hart Lane three years ago. The incident only added to the subdued atmosphere, and when Ki Sung-yueng converted from a tight angle in the 18th minute, the decibel levels — but for a small corner of visiting fans — dropped further.
